# Human – Technical Race Overview  
### Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics

Humans are the most adaptable and diverse of all mortal races.  
They lack the innate magical precision of Elves, the raw strength of Orcs, or the engineering genius of Goblins — yet they thrive in every environment through ingenuity, discipline and relentless perseverance.

In Echo of the Seven, Humans represent flexibility, potential, and the ability to shape their path through will rather than innate gifts.
