# Undead – Technical Race Overview  
### Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics

The Undead are beings who have died physically but returned through shadow-bound magic, necromantic echo, or corrupted runic rituals. They are not living creatures — their bodies are preserved by lingering essence, death-magic or echo resonance.

Undead are not monsters by default; many retain fragments of memory, identity and purpose. Some join mortal societies, others wander as outcasts. Their origin varies, but their existence breaks natural law.

# 🧬 1. Racial Fantasy  
Undead resemble classic “Forsaken-like” beings:

- pale or decayed skin  
- exposed bone fragments (depending on origin)  
- glowing eyes (shadow or echo-based)  
- stiff movement or unnaturally fluid (depending on magic)  
- lack of natural vitality but strength granted by death-magic  

Lore-wise, they fit perfectly into darker regions, cursed ruins, shadow temples and echo-warped locations.

# 🟦 2. Core Racial Traits

## **Deathless Flesh**

- immune to “starvation” debuff  
- immune to “thirst” debuff  
- takes -20% damage from Shadow magic  
- takes +15% damage from Holy magic  

## **No Metabolism**
Undead do not require:
- food

But they may require:
- *shadow essence*,  
- *echo residue*,  
- or *runic catalysts* to sustain themselves (optional future mechanic).

# 🟧 3. Racial Passives (always active)

### **Echo Memory**
Undead can sometimes “remember” fragments of their past lives.
Effect:
- +5% experience gain from ancient ruins, graveyards, crypts

---

# 🟪 4. Racial Weaknesses (to maintain balance)

### **Holy Vulnerability**
- +15% damage taken from Light / Holy sources  
- healing spells on Undead have **-10% effectiveness**  
(Priests and Paladins react differently to them in lore + gameplay)

### **Unsettling Presence**
Some NPCs distrust Undead by default:
- prices in human towns: +5%  
- reputation gain slightly slower in holy regions  
- some holy shrines refuse interaction until purified/atoned

# 🟩 5. Class Synergies

## **Strong Synergies**
- **Oracle**  
  *Echo resonance greatly enhances foresight.*

  Undead are silent, light, unaffected by pain.

  They exist half in the spirit world already.  
- **Battlemage**  
  Bone + metal manipulation works well.  
- **Spirit Ranger**  
  They hear echoes easily.

## **Neutral Synergies**
- Mage  
- Hunter
