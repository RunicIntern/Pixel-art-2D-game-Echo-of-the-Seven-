# Undead – Technical Race Overview  
### Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics

Undead are revenants who died physically but returned through shadow magic, necromancy or echo-bound resurrection.  
They do not live — they persist. Their bodies are sustained by dark essence and fractured memory.

Undead gameplay focuses on resilience, shadow synergy and identity through loss.
