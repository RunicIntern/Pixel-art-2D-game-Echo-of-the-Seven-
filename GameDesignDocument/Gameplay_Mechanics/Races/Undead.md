# Undead – Racial Traits (Balanced RPG Version)
*Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics*

Undead are revenants sustained by necrotic essence and echo-infused shadows.  
They do not breathe, hunger or tire the way mortals do, and their bodies resist the decay of time —  
but their fractured souls struggle to interface with the magic of life.

These traits create a dark, atmospheric identity without granting combat advantages.

# ⚔️ 1. Combat Flavour Bonus

### **Death’s Patience**
- **-2% Damage Taken from Damage-over-Time effects**  
  (poison, bleed, burn, rot — *non-boss only*)  

**Design Reason:**
- Undead don’t feel pain → slight resistance to *ambient* DoT  
- Does NOT affect boss mechanics or PvP  
- Perfect flavour, zero meta relevance

# 🥀 2. Racial Penalty (Identity, Not Balance)

### **Faded Essence**
Undead receive:
- **-10% effectiveness from direct healing spells cast ON them**  
  (only *healing done to the Undead player*, not healing they output)

BUT:

- Out-of-combat regeneration is NORMAL  
- Healing potions work at 100%  
- Undead healers heal others at 100%  
- Does NOT affect shields, HoTs, runes or lifesteal  
- Does NOT affect raid viability (healers compensate instantly)

**This is the perfect racial drawback:  
immersive, meaningful, but not harmful to gameplay.**

# 🧭 3. Exploration Bonus

### **Gravewalker**
Undead gain:

- **Immunity to disease, plague and curse DAMAGE**  
- Can walk through toxic miasma without penalties  
- **+15% movement speed in shadowed areas** *(visual, non-combat speed)*  
- Night vision / darkvision active at all times

This makes them *feel* supernatural without increasing combat effectiveness.

# ⚒️ 4. Utility / Crafting Bonus

### **Bonecraft Memory**
- **+10% success rate** when crafting necrotic, shadow or bone-themed items  
- Cosmetic bone patterns on crafted armour  
- Chance to salvage **Soul Dust** from broken magical items

No stat bonuses → pure RPG utility.

---

# 🤝 5. Social / Cultural Bonus

### **Aura of Unease**
Undead receive:

- **-5% prices from necromancers, shadow cultists and death vendors**  
- **+5% prices from holy-aligned merchants**  
- Extra dialogue options in:
  - crypts  
  - graveyards  
  - cursed ruins  
  - temples of Aerendel  

This is the most flavourful social trait of all races.

---

# 🧬 6. Narrative Identity Bonus (Non-Combat)

### **Lingered Echo**
- When at low HP, faint ghostly whispers are heard (immersion only)  
- Screen tint shifts slightly in strong shadow magic areas  
- Undead NPCs react differently and may greet the player as “kin”  

Zero gameplay effect — 100% atmosphere.

---

# 💀 Subrace Aesthetic Variants (Cosmetic Only)

- **Skeletal:** exposed bones, hollow jaw  
- **Wraithbound:** smoky essence, glowing eyes  
- **Corpsewalker:** partially preserved body  
- **Rune-Stitched:** ritual runes sewn into flesh  
- **Plagueborne:** fungal or rot patterns (cosmetic)

No bonuses — pure visuals.

# Summary

Undead feel:

- eerie  
- resilient  
- shadow-aligned  
- cold and calculating  
- spiritually fractured  
- culturally isolated  

Their kit includes both a **flavourful advantage** (DoT resistance, disease immunity)  
and a **signature drawback** (reduced healing received) —

— creating the *darkest, richest RPG identity* in the game without affecting endgame viability.

**“Death is not an end — merely an inconvenience.”**
