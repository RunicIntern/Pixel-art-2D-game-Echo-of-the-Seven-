# Goblin – Racial Traits (Balanced RPG Version)
*Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics*

Goblins in Aurion are chaotic inventors, explosive engineers, master scavengers and shameless opportunists.  
They survive anywhere, build everything out of nothing, and treat danger like a puzzle that needs *more gunpowder*.

Their racial traits emphasize creativity, unpredictability and gadget-based flavour — without impacting combat balance.

# ⚔️ 1. Combat Flavour Bonus

### **Chaotic Ingenuity**
When using **bombs, grenades, mines or gadgets**:
- **+2% chance for the device to trigger an additional mini-effect**  
  (sparks, smoke puff, tiny knockback, cosmetic explosion)

**Important:**
- *Zero additional damage*  
- *Zero crowd-control power*  
- Pure cosmetic chaos + fun  
- Works only on “gadget” category abilities, not spells or weapons

This gives Goblins unique *taste* without meta impact.

# 🧭 2. Exploration Bonus

### **Scrapyard Survivor**
- **+15% movement speed in cluttered environments** (ruins, debris piles, junk zones)  
- **Immune to minor environmental traps** (tiny caltrops, weak snares, broken glass)  
- Can squeeze through **narrow gaps** other races cannot

Perfect for “goblin-only shortcuts” and puzzle design.

# ⚒️ 3. Utility / Crafting Bonus

### **Precious Junk**
Goblins gain:

- **+10% scrap yield** when dismantling ANY item  
- Small chance to obtain **Unique Goblin Components**  
  (used in engineering, bombs, gadgets)

Additionally:
- Crafting bombs or traps takes **5% less time**  
- Cosmetic variations for Goblin-engineered items (duct tape, pipes, blinking lights)

# 🤝 4. Social / Cultural Bonus

### **Grease-Talk**
Goblins are… persuasive, but in a *questionable* way.

- **5% cheaper repair costs**  
- Better prices from Goblin merchants  
- Unique dialogue options involving:
  - bribery  
  - scavenging  
  - “creative solutions”  

NOT diplomacy — more like controlled chaos.

# 🧬 5. Narrative Identity Bonus (Non-Combat)

### **Explosive Curiosity**
When inspecting a strange device, chest, relic or runic mechanism:

- The Goblin performs a unique examine animation  
- Occasionally sparks or fizz appear  
- Has a **tiny chance** to discover hidden compartments in loot chests  
  (cosmetic / low-value items only — NO gear advantage)

A pure flavour perk.

# 💥 Goblin Subtypes (Cosmetic Only)

- **Boomguts:** carry volatile barrels, soot-black skin  
- **Tinkertribe:** goggles, tools, cog motifs  
- **Scrapclaw:** bone tools, scavenger armour  
- **Smogkin:** toxic green fumes, industrial style

All cosmetic — zero stats.
