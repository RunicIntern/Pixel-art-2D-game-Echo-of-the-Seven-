# Goblin – Technical Race Overview  
### Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics

Goblins are nimble, sharp-minded and absurdly adaptable beings who excel in scavenging, engineering, trickery and survival under impossible conditions.  
They are physically small but mentally explosive, with a natural talent for turning runic scraps into functioning tools, weapons or “interesting accidents.”

Goblin gameplay rewards creativity, risk-taking and unconventional solutions.
