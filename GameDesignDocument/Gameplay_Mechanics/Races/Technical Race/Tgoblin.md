# Goblin – Technical Race Overview  
### Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics

Goblins are the cunning survivors of Aurion — brilliant improvisers, chaotic tinkerers, explosive inventors and fearless scavengers.  
Small in size, but unmatched in creativity, they turn anything into a weapon, tool, trap or questionable “prototype”.

A goblin doesn’t find solutions.  
A goblin **builds** them (usually just before something explodes).

# 🧬 1. Racial Fantasy

Goblins embody:

- chaos, cleverness, unpredictable ingenuity  
- trap mastery and mechanical improvisation  
- fast hands, quick reactions, fearless experimentation  
- nomadic survival instincts  
- explosive engineering and “junkcraft” inventions  

They are comedy *and* danger — delightful madness in a small package.

# 🟥 4. Racial Weaknesses

## ⭐ **Fragile Frame**

# 🟩 5. Class Synergies

### ⭐ PERFECT WITH:
- **Rogue** → traps, poisons, stealth chaos  
- **Hunter** → trap synergy, kiting, bleed builds  
- **Shaman** → trickster spirit-talking archetypes  
- **Assassin Ranger** → hybrid burst/traps  
- **Battlemage** → mad-engineer explosive caster

### 👍 GOOD:
- Mage → chaotic elemental caster  
- Priest → weird healer archetypes (funny RP)  

### 👎 WEAK:
- Warrior → fragile, low durability  
- Paladin → huge cultural mismatch
