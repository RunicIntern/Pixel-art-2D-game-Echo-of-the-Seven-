# Orc – Technical Race Overview  
### Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics

Orcs are disciplined warriors shaped by the burning lands of Ignovar.  
Their culture is built on strength, honour, structure and relentless self-improvement.  
Where others see fury, orcs see **purposeful power**, tempered by strict codes and clan hierarchy.

An orc does not fight because he is angry.  
He fights because it is the right thing to do.

# 🧬 1. Racial Fantasy

Orcs embody:

- controlled physical might  
- disciplined combat training  
- endurance through harsh environments  
- loyalty to clan and war-teachers  
- fiery determination and warrior spirit  

They are not berserkers by nature —  
they are **soldiers, tacticians, protectors and champions of strength.**

# 🟦 2. Core Racial Traits  
*(Small, flavourful, balanced bonuses)*

## ⭐ **Ignovar Resilience**  
Orc bodies are built for battle.

**Effects:**

Gives a sturdy, battle-hardened feel without numerical power creep.

---

Orcs excel when the fight intensifies.

**Effects:**
- +3% damage when below 50% HP (all classes)  
- +3% effectiveness of self-healing effects

Encourages clutch plays and frontline bravery.

---

## ⭐ **Clan Training**  
Raised from childhood in structured combat drills.

**Effects:**
- +5% faster weapon swap time  
- +5% faster stance-change animations  
- +5% faster heavy-weapon readiness

---

# 🟧 3. Racial Passives

## ⭐ **War Discipline**  
Orcs maintain composure in battle.

**Effects:**
- -10% duration of Fear and Demoralize effects  
- +10% resistance to knockback  
- RP effect: orcs rarely break in morale-based events

---

## ⭐ **Forge-Blooded**  
Orcs adapt well to harsh climates.

**Effects:**
- Reduced environmental damage in fire, desert or volcanic zones  
- +5% gathering speed in mineral-rich areas  

(Not combat, purely utility/world immersion.)

---

# 🟥 4. Racial Weaknesses

## ⭐ **Heavy Footed**
Their powerful build has drawbacks.

- -3% movement speed  
- Slightly louder movement (small penalty for stealth classes)  

---

## ⭐ **Rigid Instinct**  
Orcs struggle with extremely subtle or delicate magical tasks.

- Small penalty to highly precise arcane crafting  
- Slight penalty to illusion-based skill checks  

Again, flavour-only, not real stat weakness.

---

# 🟩 5. Class Synergies

### ⭐ PERFECT WITH:
- **Warrior** → pure synergy with strength and discipline  
- **Berserker** → controlled rage, explosive combos  
- **Paladin** → honour, protection, flame-based hybrid  
- **Battlemage** → fire-infused martial magic  

### 👍 GOOD:
- Hunter → powerful warden or beast-hunter archetypes  
- Shaman → ancestral fire and spirit rituals  
- Rogue (strength-based builds)  

### 👎 WEAK:
- Mage → arcane finesse mismatch  
- Oracle → too subtle, too indirect for orc instincts  

(But still possible — Orc Mage is a great RP fantasy!)

---

# 🟪 6. Rune Synergy (Category-Based)

Orcs resonate best with runes tied to:

- **Fire / Heat**  
- **Strength / Impact**  
- **Blood / Rage**  
- **Protection / Endurance**  

**Effects:**
- +5% stability when crafting fire or impact-based runes  
- +5% crafting success for physical augmentation runes  

(No power creep — only improved crafting stability.)

---

# 🟫 7. Regional Synergy

Orcs thrive in:

- volcanic regions  
- deserts and scorched lands  
- war-scarred plains  
- clan fortresses  
- arenas and battlegrounds  

They struggle in:

- deep forests  
- illusion-heavy regions  
- cold, arcane-dominant zones  

(Not a gameplay penalty — world flavour.)

---

# 🟨 8. Starting Zone  
### **The Embercrag Marches**

A region of blackened stone, scorching winds and towering arena-fortresses.

Tutorial teaches:

- discipline-based combat basics  
- heavy weapon fundamentals  
- clan rites and respect hierarchy  
- Ignovar’s fire lore  
- early resistance training  

---

# 🧩 Summary

Orcs are defined by:

- strength  
- discipline  
- endurance  
- controlled fury  
- clan loyalty  

They are excellent frontline fighters, champions and defenders —  
but also capable of surprising hybrid builds.

**Identity phrase:**

### *“Strength with purpose. Fire with discipline.”*
