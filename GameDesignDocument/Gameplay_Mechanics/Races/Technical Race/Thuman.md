# Human – Technical Race Overview  
### Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics

Humans are the most adaptable, unpredictable and fast-learning people of Aurion.  
They lack the innate strengths of other races — no stone-born toughness, no elven grace, no orcish power —  
but they compensate with **exceptional versatility**.

Humans succeed not because the world shaped them well,  
but because they learn how to shape themselves to the world.
