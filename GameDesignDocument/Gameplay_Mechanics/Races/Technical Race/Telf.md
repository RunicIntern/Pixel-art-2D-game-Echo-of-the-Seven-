# Elf – Technical Race Overview  
### Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics

Elves in Aurion are not serene forest nobles.  
They are **storm-touched shapeshifters of instinct, emotion and primal energy.**  
Born from the wildest zones of the Domain of Change, they embody volatility, agility and raw elemental resonance.

Elves do not *live* with nature.  
They are nature in motion.

- instinct-driven combat and movement  
- fluidity of shape, motion and expression  

Their entire culture values adaptability, sensation, freedom and wild creativity.  
Elves are beauty sharpened into a blade.
