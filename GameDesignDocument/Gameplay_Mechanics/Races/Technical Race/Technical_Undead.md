# Undead – Technical Race Overview  
### Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics

Undead are not mindless monsters.  
They are revenants — individuals who died, yet returned through shadow magic, necromantic rites, or echo-infused resurrection.  
Some regained fragments of memory, others rebuilt their identity from the ashes of a forgotten life.

An Undead is not defined by death.  
They are defined by what remains.

# 🧬 1. Racial Fantasy

Undead embody:

- resilience to decay and corruption  
- fractured identity and lost memories  
- unnatural stamina and cold detachment  
- spiritual echoes linking them to the Shadow domain  
- immunity to mortal weaknesses (hunger, disease)  

They walk the world with purpose — redemption, vengeance, curiosity, or simply the instinct to keep moving.

# 🟦 2. Core Racial Traits  
*(Flavourful, balanced, no combat power creep)*

## ⭐ **Deathless Physiology**  
Their bodies function outside normal biological rules.

**Effects:**
- Immune to disease  
- Immune to poison  
- No need for food or water (but may gain small buffs from consuming essence items)  
- +5% resistance to Shadow and Corruption damage  

Powerful flavour without numerical stat inflation.

---

## ⭐ **Cold of the Grave**  
Their presence chills the air.

**Effects:**
- +5% resistance to Frost  
- Slight penalty inflicted on nearby low-tier undead mobs (they hesitate)  
- Very slight intimidation effect on weak enemies (RP mostly)

---

## ⭐ **Echo Bound Soul**  
Part of their essence exists between life and death.

**Effects:**
- +5% stability when interacting with shadow or echo-based runes  
- +5% success when performing necromantic or spiritual skill checks  
- Reduced penalties when walking through shadow-corrupted zones  

---

# 🟧 3. Racial Passives

## ⭐ **Unnatural Stamina**  
Their bodies simply don’t tire the same way.

**Effects:**
- -10% stamina loss when sprinting  
- No exhaustion from starvation or dehydration  
- +5% endurance skill proficiency  

---

## ⭐ **Faded Memories**  
Their past returns in fragments.

**Effects:**
- Occasional unique dialogue options  
- Rare interactions with Fallen, ghosts or echo spirits  
- Access to a few Undead-only hidden lore shrines  

(Does not affect gameplay power.)

---

# 🟥 4. Racial Weaknesses  
True to theme, Undead suffer from several drawbacks.

## ⭐ **Holy Vulnerability**
Their form reacts violently to radiant energy.

- +5% damage taken from Holy or Radiant effects  
- Priests notice their nature immediately (flavour)

---

## ⭐ **Fragile Essence**  
They cannot heal naturally the same way the living do.

- Reduced natural HP regeneration out of combat  
- Potions heal slightly less unless modified for Undead physiology  

(Not punishing — just thematic.)

# 🟩 5. Class Synergies

### ⭐ PERFECT WITH:
- **Mage** → shadow, frost, corruption builds  
- **Rogue** → poison-immune combat tricks  
- **Priest → Oracle** (shadow-light hybrid arcana)  
- **Shaman** → ancestral echo interactions  
- **Spirit Ranger** → strong synergy with spiritual echoes  

### 👍 GOOD:
- Battlemage → frost/shadow melee archetypes  
- Spellblade → deathbound duelist  

### 👎 WEAK:
- Paladin → holy damage antisynergy  
- Druid → mismatch with nature’s life essence  
- Warden → physical vitality conflict  

---

# 🟪 6. Rune Synergy (Category-Based)

Undead naturally resonate with:

- **Shadow / Death / Corruption**  
- **Echo / Memory**  
- **Cold / Stillness**  
- **Soul-binding**  

**Effects:**
- +5% rune stability for shadow/echo categories  
- +5% crafting efficiency for soul-related rune interactions  

---

# 🟫 7. Regional Synergy

Undead thrive in:

- shadowlands  
- ruined necropolises  
- echo-scarred battlefields  
- cursed temples  
- cold regions  

They struggle in:

- holy-dominant cities  
- heavily radiant areas  
- druidic sanctuaries  
- volcanic fire realms  

(Flavour only, no hard gameplay penalties.)

---

# 🟨 8. Starting Zone  
### **The Whispering Necropolis**

A fallen kingdom suspended between life and echo.  
Shadows whisper forgotten memories as revenants rise once more.

Tutorial highlights:

- managing Undead physiology  
- interacting with shadow and echo shrines  
- early frost/shadow magic exposure  
- lore on death, corruption and resurrection  
- unique Undead-only questlines

# 🧩 Summary

Undead are defined by:

- resilience to mortal harm  
- unique interactions with shadow and echo  
- fractured identity and deep lore hooks  
- immunity to poison, disease, hunger  
- thematic weaknesses to holy magic  

They offer a dark, atmospheric playstyle without granting mechanical dominance.

**Identity phrase:**

### *“We do not live. We endure.”*
