# Beastborn – Technical Race Overview  
### Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics

“Beastborn” is a collective term for all humanoid-animal hybrids shaped by the Domain of Change.  
These tribes are not mutations or half-beasts — they are **true peoples**, each with ancient traditions, distinct societies and deep instinctual magic.

Wolfborn, Bearfolk, Feline Striders, Lizardkin, Avian Nomads — all fall under the Beastborn banner, yet each tribe is its own culture.

They are the pulse of the wild.  
The voice of instinct.  
The untamed heart of Aurion.
