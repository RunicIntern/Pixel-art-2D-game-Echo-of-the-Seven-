# Beastfolk (Bestial) – Technical Race Overview  
### Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics

Beastfolk, commonly called Bestials, are primal humanoids with strong animalistic traits — feline, lupine, reptilian or ursine depending on clan lineage.  
Their bodies are a perfect fusion of muscle, instinct and natural magic, shaped by the wild regions they inhabit.

Bestials are fierce hunters, masters of mobility, and dominant predators who fight with instinctive precision rather than refined technique.
