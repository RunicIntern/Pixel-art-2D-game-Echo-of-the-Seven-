# Beastborn – Racial Traits (Balanced RPG Version)
*Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics*

Beastborn are hybrid tribes shaped by instinct, territory and the wild power of the Domain of Change.  
They embody primal senses, swift reactions and keen awareness of their environment.

Although their appearance varies (wolfborn, bearfolk, felines, avians, lizardkin),  
all Beastborn share a common set of racial traits representing their deep connection to nature.

# ⚔️ 1. Combat Flavour Bonus

### **Predator’s Precision**
- **+2% Critical Chance on attacks made from behind (rear attacks)**  
- Applies to melee, ranged and unarmed strikes  
- Does *not* apply to spells or AoE abilities

**Why this is balanced:**
- Requires positioning → NOT always active  
- Rewards skilled players without buffing raw DPS  
- Perfect fantasy for hunters, rogues, shamans, beast warriors

---

# 🧭 2. Exploration Bonus

### **Wild Instincts**
Beastborn gain:

- **+15% Tracking Range**  
  (monsters, footprints, scent trails, hidden caches)  
- **Reduced noise** when walking or crouching  
- **+10% climb speed** on vines, roots and natural surfaces

This reinforces the “hunter of the wilds” identity.

# ⚒️ 3. Utility / Gathering Bonus

### **Primal Forager**
- **+10% yield when gathering natural resources**  
  (herbs, pelts, hides, feathers, bones, fungi)  
- Small chance to find **rare natural materials**  
  (roleplay value, no direct gameplay advantage)

---

# 🤝 4. Social / Cultural Bonus

### **Tribal Kinship**
Beastborn receive:

- **+5% reputation gain** with druidic, shamanic and wild clans  
- Access to unique tribal cosmetics  
- Unique emotes/animations (sniff, growl, howl)  
- Special dialogue options with nature-aligned NPCs

---

# 🧬 5. Narrative Identity / Non-Combat Sense Bonus

### **Predator Sense**
- Slight screen highlight for nearby hostile creatures  
  *(NOT a detection buff — purely visual ambience)*  
- Faint auditory cues for hidden beasts or approaching predators

Makes Beastborn feel alive and instinct-driven without affecting combat stats.

# 🟫 Variant Flavour (Optional Cosmetic Tags)
To emphasize sub-races:

- **Wolfborn:** howl emote, grey colour palettes  
- **Bearfolk:** heavier animations, deeper roar emote  
- **Feline tribes:** faster idle sways, clawed casting animation  
- **Avians:** wider jump arc (visual only)  
- **Lizardkin:** unique swim animation and dripping footsteps

None of these change gameplay balance — only visuals and roleplay.

- primal  
- instinctive  
- territorial  
- swift and aware
