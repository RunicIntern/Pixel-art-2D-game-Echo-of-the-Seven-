# Orc – Racial Traits (Balanced RPG Version)
*Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics*

Orcs are disciplined warriors forged by the volcanic plains of Ignovar.  
They value honour, structure, ritual combat and purpose-driven strength.  
Their bodies are powerful, their voices commanding, and their culture steeped in martial tradition.

These racial traits reflect their physical discipline and battlefield presence without granting raw combat power.

# ⚔️ 1. Combat Flavour Bonus

### **Controlled Ferocity**
- **+2% Damage ONLY when hitting enemies above 90% Health**  
  (Opening Strike bonus)

**Design Reason:**
- Encourages aggressive engagement  
- Zero influence on boss phases or PvP balance  
- Represents "first hit impact" — not sustained DPS  
- The small bonus disappears quickly → flavour only

# 🧭 2. Exploration Bonus

### **Warbound Endurance**
Orcs gain:

- **-10% stamina drain while sprinting outside combat**  
- **+10% swim speed**  
- Less slowdown when walking through mud, ash or shallow water

Because orcs are trained to march across hostile terrain.
