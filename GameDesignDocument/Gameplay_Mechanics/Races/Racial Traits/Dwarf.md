# Dwarf – Racial Traits (Balanced RPG Version)
*Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics*

Dwarves are sturdy, iron-willed people forged in stone fortresses, volcanic forges and ancient runic halls.  
Their racial traits support their cultural identity without disrupting gameplay balance.

---

## ⚔️ 1. Combat Flavour Bonus

### **Blackpowder Instinct**
Dwarves gain:
- **+2% Critical Chance when using Firearm Weapons**  
  (Rifles, Muskets, Blackpowder Shotguns)

**Notes:**
- Applies only to weapon-based attacks (skills that consume ammo).
- Does *not* increase spell crit chance.
- Affects Hunters, some Rogues, Spellmarksmans, and firearm-based subclasses.

A small boost, but *purely thematic*.

## 🧭 2. Exploration Bonuses

### **Deepwalker Physiology**
- **-10% Fall Damage**
- **Enhanced visibility in dark areas** (caves, mines, crypts)  
  *(purely visual, does not increase detection radius)*

These traits reflect dwarven life underground.

## ⚒️ 3. Crafting / Utility Bonuses

### **Forge Heritage**
Items crafted by a Dwarf have:
- **+5% Durability**
- Unique dwarven visual variants (engraving, metalwork patterns)

No increase to power — only longevity and cosmetics.

---

## 🤝 4. Social / Cultural Bonus

### **Clan Reputation**
- Dwarven NPC merchants give **2–5% better prices**
- Access to dwarf-only cosmetic patterns in forge cities
- Special dialogue options with smithing factions

This makes them feel culturally grounded.

---

## 🪨 5. Narrative Identity Bonus

### **Stoneborn Resilience** *(non-combat effect)*
- Slight resistance to environmental hazards (lava heat, cave dust, freezing storms)
- Reduced stagger animation (no combat advantage)

# Summary

Dwarves feel:

- tough  
- stubborn  
- master-crafted  
- firearm-savvy  
- culturally unique  

…but remain **perfectly balanced** with all other races.

“**Built of stone. Tempered by fire. Deadly with gunpowder.**”
