# Human – Racial Traits (Balanced RPG Version)
*Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics*

Humans are defined by adaptability, ambition, diplomacy and remarkable learning speed.  
They lack the innate strengths of other races, but compensate with versatility, culture and rapid mastery of skills.

---

# ⚔️ 1. Combat Flavour Bonus

### **Adaptive Instinct**
- **+1% Global Critical Chance**  
  (applies to any weapon type, including melee, ranged and firearms)

**Notes:**
- This is the smallest combat bonus among all races.
- It reinforces the fantasy that humans "excel through practice," not natural gifts.
- Does not stack with class-specific crit modifiers.

---

# 🧭 2. Exploration Bonus

### **Pathfinder**
- **+10% stamina regeneration while out of combat**  
- Slightly faster interaction speed with exploration objects  
  *(opening crates, searching ruins, climbing ropes, etc.)*

Pure utility, zero combat impact.

---

# ⚒️ 3. Crafting / Utility Bonus

### **Jack-of-All-Trades**
Humans learn any crafting profession **5% faster**  
(xp progression only — does NOT improve item strength).

Additionally:
- +5% success chance when salvaging materials  
- access to universal crafting styles (neutral themes)

This represents human adaptability.

# 🤝 4. Social / Cultural Bonus

### **Diplomat’s Tongue**
- **+5% Reputation gain** with all neutral factions  
- Better initial prices at human settlements  
- Additional dialogue choices in diplomatic quests

Humans are culturally integrated across Aurion.

---

# 🧬 5. Narrative Identity Bonus

### **Versatile Heritage** *(non-combat effect)*
Humans have slight resistance to:
- fear  
- confusion  
- charm  

(Only reduces **duration** of those effects visually by ~5%;  
does NOT reduce actual PvP/PvE crowd-control balance.)

This visually reinforces human mental resilience without altering gameplay.

# Summary

Humans excel through:

- adaptability  
- diplomatic versatility  
- faster learning  
- balanced gameplay identity  

They are not the strongest, fastest, or toughest race —  
but they are **the most flexible**, making them ideal for players who enjoy freedom of class choice and crafting routes.

**“Not born extraordinary — but capable of becoming anything.”**
