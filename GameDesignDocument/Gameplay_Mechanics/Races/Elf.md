# Elf – Racial Traits (Balanced RPG Version)
*Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics*

Elves of Aurion are wild, storm-touched beings shaped by the Domain of Change.  
They are quick, emotionally volatile, deeply attuned to nature and the living storms that pulse through Seranthis.

Their racial traits emphasize agility, intuition and elemental resonance — without granting combat advantages.

# ⚔️ 1. Combat Flavour Bonus

### **Storm Reflexes**
- **+2% Dodge Chance against NON-boss, NON-player attacks**  
  (trash mobs, wildlife, ambient creatures)

**Design Reason:**  
This gives elves a fantasy of agility without affecting endgame/raids/PvP.

Bosses and players ignore this bonus → zero meta impact.

---

# 🧭 2. Exploration Bonus

### **Windrunner Step**
Elves gain:

- **+10% movement speed while out of combat**  
  *(visual effect only — does NOT modify actual combat speed)*  
- **Reduced fall damage by 5%**  
- Ability to cross narrow tree branches without slipping (environmental perk)

Perfect for forest, cliff and high-mobility zones.

# ✨ 3. Magic / Utility Bonus

### **Natural Attunement**
- **+5% mana regeneration while out of combat**  
- Small chance to detect **elemental anomalies**  
  (storm crystals, life-infused plants, mana geysers)

No combat regen bonus → zero impact on balance.

# 🤝 4. Social / Cultural Bonus

### **Grace of Seranthis**
- +5% reputation with druidic orders, ranger enclaves and nature spirits  
- Elves receive special greetings and dialogue options in Seranthis  
- Access to unique elven dyes and ornaments

---

# 🧬 5. Narrative Identity Bonus (Non-Combat Sense)

### **Stormsense**
- Elves feel approaching weather changes (screen tint shifts subtly before storms)  
- Slight shimmer around wind-element creatures  
- Enhanced ambient sound cues in forests and magical zones  

Pure immersion. No gameplay advantage.

# 🌿 Subrace Cosmetic Variants (Optional)

- **Storm Elves:** lightning sparks in idle animations  
- **Wood Elves:** leaf particles, softer movement  
- **Moon Elves:** glow in night areas  
- **Sand Elves:** desert-coloured cloth and skin tones  

These are cosmetic only — no mechanical differences.
