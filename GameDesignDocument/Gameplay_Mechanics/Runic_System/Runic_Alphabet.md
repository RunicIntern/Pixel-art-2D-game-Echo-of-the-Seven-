# Runic Alphabet – Player Discovery Version  
### Echo of the Seven – Runic System

The Runic Alphabet is a living, ancient language left behind after the Runic Cataclysm.  
It is **not fully known**, **not fully recorded**, and **not fully understood**.  
Only fragments survived in ruins, statues, relics and the memories of the few remaining Guardians.

## 🟪 Core Philosophy  
Players **do not start with the full alphabet**.  
They discover letters, meanings and effects by:

- exploring dungeons and ruins,  
- reading ancient tablets,  
- interacting with shrines,  
- observing runes used by enemies,  
- piecing together glyphs from fragments,  
- experimenting with crafting.

## 🟧 Word Creation  
A rune word requires **2–3 letters**:

- ✔ correct combination → rune activates  
- ✖ incorrect combination → rune cracks and breaks  

The player’s **Runic Library** automatically records:

- discovered letters  
- discovered words  
- learned combinations  
- their effects

## 🟦 Starting Knowledge  
Players begin with only a few basic letters found during early quests.  
All advanced letters must be discovered in the world.

## 🟫 Notable Features  
- No full alphabet is ever shown to the players.  
- The system rewards exploration and experimentation.  
- Every discovered letter has meaning, hidden lore, and mechanical effect.  
- Some rare letters can only be found in optional endgame content.

The Runic Alphabet is a mystery — one that every player uncovers at their own pace.
