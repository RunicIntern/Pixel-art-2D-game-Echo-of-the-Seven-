# Rune Alphabet – World Design Overview

> _“A rune without a mark is just a polished stone.”_

This document describes the **runic alphabet as a world-system**:  
how glyphs exist in the world, where players can encounter them, and how they gradually discover letters and partial words.

It **does not** cover:
- rune items,
- rune crafting,
- stat scaling,
- or the UI details of the Runic Journal (see `rune_journal.md` for that).

Here we focus purely on the **fiction and placement of the alphabet** itself.

## 1. Core Idea

In this world, magical power does not come from the stone itself, but from the **mark** carved into it.

- An unmarked rune stone is just a **mundane object**.
- A marked rune stone carries **meaning** – and meaning is what the magic responds to.

The runic alphabet is:

- **Ancient** – older than current kingdoms and religions.
- **Fragmented** – nobody in the world knows it fully.
- **Everywhere** – its letters and fragments appear:
  - in dungeons,
  - along roads,
  - in libraries,
  - on personal items,
  - in shrines and temples.

Players never receive a full “alphabet table”.  
Instead, they **piece it together** from:

- glyphs carved into the environment,
- NPC dialogue,
- old texts,
- puzzles and secret rooms.

## 2. Letters, Fragments and Words

For world-building, we treat the language at three levels:

### 2.1. Letter (Glyph)

A **letter** is a single runic symbol:

- a standalone glyph that represents:
  - an element,
  - an abstract idea,
  - a divine aspect,
  - an emotion, oath or curse.
- by itself it has **no direct gameplay effect**,
- but it:
  - appears in puzzles,
  - hints at the “family” of some future rune,
  - gives the player a visual identity to recognise later.

### 2.2. Fragment (Half-word)

A **fragment** is a partial sequence of letters:

- for example:
  - the first two letters of a three-letter word,
  - or a broken inscription where part of the wall is missing.
- it tells the player:
  - “there is a bigger word behind this”,
  - “someone knew the language, but the rest is lost or hidden”.

Fragments are used to:

- tease upcoming content,
- hint that a library, NPC or puzzle might hold “the missing piece”.

### 2.3. Word

A **word** is a complete sequence of letters:

- only **full words** can later be carved onto rune stones to create actual magical runes,
- in this document we only care about words as **lore objects**:
  - ancient inscriptions,
  - names whispered by NPCs,
  - scripts on monuments and shrines.

The gameplay side of words-as-runes is defined separately.

## 3. Where Letters Appear in the World

The runic alphabet is **global**, but context matters.  
The same symbol can show up:

- in holy places as a symbol of faith,
- in a war memorial as a symbol of oath,
- in a dungeon as part of a seal.

This keeps things mysterious and slightly contradictory, on purpose.

### 3.1. Dungeons and Ancient Ruins

Dungeons and ruins are primary sources of **old, raw glyphs**:

- Letters carved into:
  - walls,
  - doors,
  - sarcophagi,
  - altars.
- Sometimes they glow faintly if:
  - the player has already seen the same symbol elsewhere,
  - or carries related runic items (later in progression).

Usage examples:

- A sealed door with three glyphs:
  - the player may only recognise one of them at first,
  - later, after discovering more letters, they realise the pattern.
- Stone pedestals:
  - each with a different letter,
  - used in “align the glyphs” style puzzles.

Fragments of parchment or tablets can also be found:

- containing:
  - a single letter with a scribbled note like:
    - “used in rituals of fire”,
  - or two letters from a broken word.

### 3.2. Roadside Shrines, Wayside Chapels and Small Sanctuaries

Small shrines along roads are ideal for **faith- and blessing-related letters**.

Example: a wayside chapel:

- A small statue of a god or saint.
- On the stone base, **one carved glyph**, weathered but still visible.
- This glyph may later appear in:
  - larger temples,
  - holy tomes,
  - or blessing-related rune words.

Lore-wise:

- someone (a priest, traveller or ancient hero) carved it long ago,
- common folk repeat and maintain the mark without understanding its true meaning.

### 3.3. Cities, Libraries and Academies

In major cities, the alphabet feels more “domesticated”:

**Libraries**

- Shelves with:
  - research notes,
  - half-burned manuscripts,
  - marginal sketches of glyphs.
- Books that:
  - show a letter alongside a rough description:
    - “associated with ‘shield’ or ‘ward’”,
    - “appears in old contracts and oaths”.
- Fragments of longer texts:
  - half-phrases containing 2 of 3 letters of a word,
  - cross-references: “see also: temple murals in the northern provinces”.

**Academies / Mage Guilds / Scholarly Orders**

- Training boards with a few “safe” symbols.
- Instructors might:
  - show a glyph during dialogue,
  - ask the player to find another place where that glyph appears in the world.
- This is where the player learns to **interpret** letters,
  - but never gets a complete and perfect dictionary.

### 3.4. Graves, Camps, Personal Items

Some letters are deeply personal:

- engraved on:
  - amulets,
  - weapons,
  - rings,
  - prayer beads,
- carved into gravestones instead of a written name,
- painted on shields or banners.

This shows that:

- different cultures use the same alphabet in their own ways,
- the same letter might:
  - mean “light” to a priest,
  - “oath” to a knight,
  - and “purge” to a fanatic cult.

That ambiguity is intentional and supports the feeling that **no-one fully understands the language anymore**.

## 4. How Players Discover the Alphabet

Players do **not** unlock the alphabet as a clean table.  
Instead, every encounter with a glyph or fragment is a small piece of a huge puzzle.

### 4.1. Simply Seeing Symbols in the World

Whenever the player:

- examines a wall with a glyph,
- interacts with a shrine,
- inspects a grave or monument,

the game can record that the symbol has been **seen**.

Later, a UI element (Runic Journal, Codex, etc.) can:

- show the sketch of that symbol,
- label it as “seen but unexplained”,
- list the known locations where it appears.

At this stage:

- no meaning is shown,
- only the fact that:
  - “you’ve seen this glyph before, in these contexts”.

### 4.2. NPCs as Teachers of Letters and Words

Certain NPCs specialise in runes:

- a mad scholar who lost everything to runic experiments,
- an old priest who still remembers forbidden texts,
- a retired runesmith or exiled sage.

They may:

- **explain a single letter**:
  - “This mark is sometimes called ‘the Oath’. Some say it protects, others say it binds.”
- **whisper a full word** (as a quest reward or sign of trust):
  - not purely mechanical, but with lore attached.
- **comment on symbols the player has already seen**:
  - if the player shows them a glyph via dialogue option.

This creates a loop where the player must **combine world exploration with NPC knowledge**.

### 4.3. Minigames, Secret Rooms and Puzzle Rewards

Glyphs and fragments also serve as rewards for:

- **secret rooms**:
  - hidden levers,
  - illusory walls,
  - obscure shortcuts.
- **environmental puzzles**:
  - arranging statues,
  - rotating stone rings with glyphs,
  - matching patterns seen elsewhere in the world.
- **dedicated “runic puzzles”**:
  - assembling broken pieces of a symbol,
  - aligning parts of a mural to form a correct glyph.

Successful completion can reward the player with:

- a **new letter** they have never seen before,
- a **fragment (half-word)** carved on a special wall or tablet,
- or an updated understanding of a glyph they already know.

## 5. Why the Alphabet is Fragmented

In lore, there are several reasons why the alphabet is scattered:

1. **Ancient Collapse**
   - The full language belonged to a civilisation that no longer exists.
   - Current kingdoms only inherited fragments:
     - a few prayers,
     - some contracts,
     - half-remembered war chants.

2. **Fear and Censorship**
   - Rulers, churches and guilds do not want everyone to master runes:
     - dangerous magic,
     - binding oaths,
     - forbidden pacts.
   - As a result:
     - books were burned,
     - pages were torn out,
     - texts were deliberately encoded.

3. **Multiple Interpretations**
   - The same letter can have:
     - a theological meaning,
     - a legal meaning,
     - a magical meaning.
   - No authority agrees on a single “true” translation.

4. **Living Knowledge**
   - Runes are not a dead language:
     - some glyphs react to blood, mana or prayer,
     - some glow brighter for characters with certain stats or reputations.
   - This suggests that the language is somehow **bound to the world itself**, not just ink on paper.

From a design perspective, fragmentation allows:

- meaningful exploration (every region can contain new pieces),
- “knowledge as power”:
  - players who pay attention understand more,
- community sharing:
  - players create their own rune glossaries and theories.

## 6. Design Principles Summary

- The runic alphabet is a **shared, global system**:
  - the same letters appear across dungeons, cities, shrines and personal items.
- Players discover it **gradually** by:
  - seeing glyphs,
  - reading partial texts,
  - talking to NPCs,
  - solving puzzles.
- Letters and fragments are:
  - **lore objects** first,
  - **gameplay ingredients** later (when used in rune crafting).
- Meaning is:
  - often incomplete,
  - sometimes contradictory,
  - intentionally mysterious.

For UI and tracking details (how glyphs and fragments are recorded, what the player sees in their Codex), see the separate document: `rune_journal.md`.
