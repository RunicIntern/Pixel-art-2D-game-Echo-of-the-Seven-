# Runic Alphabet – Player Discovery Version  
### Echo of the Seven – Runic System

The Runic Alphabet is a living, ancient language left behind after the Runic Cataclysm.  
It is **not fully known**, **not fully recorded**, and **not fully understood**.  
Only fragments survived in ruins, statues, relics and the memories of a few remaining guardians and scholars.

---

## 🟪 Core Philosophy

Players **do not start with the full alphabet**.  
They slowly piece it together by paying attention to the world and experimenting.

You will discover runic glyphs by:

- exploring dungeons and forgotten ruins,  
- reading ancient tablets and broken inscriptions,  
- interacting with roadside shrines and hidden chapels,  
- examining gravestones, relics and personal trinkets,  
- observing runes used by enemies and bosses,  
- solving environmental and runic puzzles,  
- later: testing letter combinations at rune-crafting stations.

At first, a glyph is **just a mysterious symbol** in your notes.  
Only when letters are combined into full words do they gain real magical power.

## 🟦 Letters, Fragments and Words

### Letters (Glyphs)

- Single symbols carved into stone, metal, bone or wood.  
- Represent ideas like:
  - oaths, protection, fury, fire, light, faith, etc.  
- On their own they are **lore and clues**, not active magic:
  - they matter in puzzles,
  - they hint at future rune effects,
  - they are ingredients for later word creation.

### Fragments (Half-words)

- Partial inscriptions: two letters of three, or a broken sequence on a wall.  
- Tell you that there is a **larger, complete word** somewhere in the world.  
- Often tied to:
  - secret rooms,
  - hidden passages,
  - or optional side quests.

### Words

- Full sequences of 2–3 letters that form a **runic word**.  
- Only complete words can be carved onto rune stones to create **functional runes**.  
- Early in the game, you mostly see them:
  - on ancient monuments,
  - in enemy magic,
  - in scraps of text or whispered by NPCs.  
- The **gameplay side** of words-as-runes (stats, effects, crafting) is handled in separate rune documents.

## 🟧 Where Glyphs Appear

To keep the alphabet feeling like a true, ancient language, the same glyphs can appear in many contexts:

- **Dungeons & Ruins**  
  - Carved into doors, pillars, sarcophagi and altar stones.  
  - Used in seal puzzles and secret mechanisms.

- **Roadside Shrines & Chapels**  
  - Single letters etched into small wayside altars.  
  - Often related to faith, blessing or protection:  
    - for example, a hidden letter of “faith” left long ago by a travelling priest.

- **Cities, Libraries & Academies**  
  - Research notes, marginal sketches and half-burned pages.  
  - Scholars argue about meanings and translate symbols differently.  
  - Good place to get **partial explanations** of glyphs you’ve already seen.

- **Graves, Camps & Personal Items**  
  - A glyph instead of a name on a tombstone.  
  - Symbols on amulets, shields or banners.  
  - Show how different cultures use the same letter for different purposes.

- **Enemies & Bosses**  
  - Some foes wear glyphs on armour, weapons or totems.  
  - Their attacks may reveal how certain letters are used in powerful words.

Because of this, **no single explanation is ever “final”**.  
Different factions, religions and cultures interpret the same symbols in their own ways.

## 🟨 Word Creation (High-Level Player View)

A **rune word** usually requires **2–3 letters**:

- ✔ A correct, meaningful combination → a stable rune is created.  
- ✖ A wrong or nonsense combination → the stone stays inert, cracks, or becomes unstable.

As a player, you will learn working words by:

- finding existing inscriptions and copying them,  
- having NPCs teach you full words as rewards,  
- discovering fragments and guessing the missing letters,  
- experimenting at rune stations once the crafting system is unlocked.

You are never handed a full list of recipes.  
**Discovery and experimentation are part of the fantasy.**

## 🟦 Runic Journal & Runic Library

Two in-game systems help you keep track of what you’ve learned:

### Runic Journal

- Records:
  - glyphs (letters) you’ve seen,  
  - where you saw them (shrines, walls, tombs, etc.),  
  - notes and quotes from NPCs about those symbols.  
- Shows **partial knowledge**:
  - “You’ve seen this symbol at a roadside chapel and in a ruined temple.”  
  - It does **not** automatically reveal full meanings or recipes.

### Runic Library

- Records:
  - confirmed **rune words** you have successfully activated,  
  - the **letter combinations** that work,  
  - the **known effects** of those words.  
- Over time becomes your personal **spellbook of working runes**.

The Journal is about **mystery and context**.  
The Library is about **proven, usable magic**.

## 🟩 Starting Knowledge

At the beginning of the game:

- You know **no formal alphabet**.  
- You may encounter a few common glyphs during early quests:
  - on shrines,
  - in simple ruins,
  - or in basic training texts.

Only later in the story (after key quests / milestones) do you:

- gain access to proper rune-crafting,  
- start intentionally combining letters into working words.

All advanced letters and powerful words must be:

- **discovered in the world**,  
- or **earned** through challenging content.

---

## 🟫 Notable Features

- No full alphabet table is ever shown to players.  
- Knowledge is fragmented, contradictory and earned through play.  
- Letters on their own are **lore, clues and puzzle pieces**;  
  their **mechanical power appears only when combined into full words**.  
- Exploration, note-taking and theory-crafting are rewarded.  
- The world itself becomes a “text” to read: every glyph, shrine and inscription might be part of a much larger sentence.  
- Some rare letters and words can only be found in **optional, high-level or endgame content**, making mastery of the language a long-term goal.

The Runic Alphabet is a mystery — one that every player uncovers at their own pace, in their own way.
