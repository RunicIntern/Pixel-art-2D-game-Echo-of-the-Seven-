# Special Class Skills  
### Unique Class Actions for Tier 1 & Tier 2 Classes  
### Echo of the Seven – Gameplay Mechanics

This document lists all **non-combat, exploration-focused** special abilities that each class unlocks.  
These actions define class identity **outside battle** and are crucial for exploration, secrets, puzzles, lore interaction and dungeon progression.

They:
- cannot be used to deal combat damage or crowd control in fights,  
- are designed for exploration, story, puzzles and world interaction,  
- scale mainly with **use count**, **class evolution** and sometimes **rune categories** (never specific rune words).

---

# 🟦 TIER 1 – UNIQUE CLASS ACTIONS  
Each base class has one exploration ability available from Level 1.

These skills create identity, utility and unique value for every class outside combat.

## 🗡 Rogue — **Lockpicking & Trap Disarming**

Rogues can open locks and disable traps others cannot.

### Mastery by Use Count:
- **Tier 1** → unlocked by default  
- **Tier 2** → after 100 uses  
- **Tier 3** → after 500 uses  
- **Tier 4** → after 3000 uses  

### Effects:
- Open locked chests (higher mastery → higher lock tiers)  
- Open sealed or ancient doors  
- Disable mechanical and magical traps  
- Reveal alternative “Rogue-only” paths in dungeons

### Other Classes:
- Can learn a **limited magical lockpick** from a rare NPC.

  - can only open lower-tier locks,  
  - never reaches full Rogue mastery.

## 🔮 Mage — **Waygate Recall**

Mages can manipulate spatial echoes to create small teleport rifts to **previously discovered locations**.

### Effects:
- Teleport to:
  - major cities,  
  - waygates / obelisks,  
  - leyline nodes previously attuned.  
- Higher mastery:
  - reduces casting time,  
  - improves teleport accuracy (less risk of minor penalties or misplacement),  
  - allows saving more waygate slots.

### Other Classes:
- Can only travel via:
  - static portals,  
  - obelisks,  
  - teleport scrolls created by Mages or crafters.  

Mages do not gain combat advantage from this skill – it is purely for travel and exploration.

## ✨ Priest — **Divine Benediction**

Priests perform sacred rituals to purify, bless and receive guidance from their deity.

    - hidden or safe paths.  

### Scaling:
- Higher spiritual attributes → clearer guidance from shrines.  
- Different deities → different flavour of hints (radiant, shadowy, nature, echo-themed).

No specific rune words are required. Priests interact with divine domains, not the alphabet itself.

---

- Nature-themed rune categories may further refine information (type of creature, danger level).

---

- Reveal illusionary doors, walls or fake floors  
- Predict types of traps ahead (not exact positions)

- Enter hidden echo chambers and spirit shrines  
- Speak with echo-versions of past NPCs or bosses (lore & hints)

Shaman’s body remains in place and is vulnerable; Spirit Walk is strictly non-combat.

---

## 🗡🏹 Assassin Ranger — **Shadow Tracking**

Assassin Rangers combine hunting instinct with rogue subtlety.

### Effects:
- Track invisible or stealth-capable enemies  
- Reveal blood trails from fleeing targets  
- Discover assassin-only routes and vantage points

Druids commune with nature’s core memories in special groves, stones and ancient trees.

### Effects:
- Restore withered paths (growing living bridges, roots, vines)  
- Open nature-locked passages (thorn walls, bramble barriers, overgrown doors)  
- Calm dangerous environmental effects (storms, toxic spores, aggressive flora)  
- Reveal the “lifespan memory” of a place — what nature has seen there  
- At higher mastery → temporarily awaken ancient groves to unlock secret side areas  

Druid’s power is strongest in wild regions, forests and places tied to the Domain of Change.
