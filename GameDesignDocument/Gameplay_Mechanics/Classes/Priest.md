# Priest  
### Tier 1 Base Class – Echo of the Seven

The Priest is the spiritual anchor of every party — a wielder of divine light, protective wards and restorative echoes.  
In Echo of the Seven, a Priest is not merely a healer. They serve as a conduit between mortals and the divine, bending the seven domains’ energies to preserve life, empower allies and purge corruption.

Priests are versatile, resilient, and unique in their ability to enhance runic effects on allies through divine resonance.

## 🧬 Lore  
Priests are the spiritual stewards of Aurion.  
They do not serve a single deity — rather, each Priest chooses a divine path that resonates with their beliefs, shaping their healing techniques and combat rituals.

While many Priests follow Luminara, the Goddess of Light, others walk darker or more unusual roads:

- **Umbros Priests** wield shadowed blessings and deceptive illusions.  
- **Archivion Priests** restore knowledge through runic memory magic.  
- **Aerendel Priests** channel clarity, swiftness and spatial harmony.  
- **Ignovar Priests** heal through fiery determination and battle hymns.

This diversity makes the Priest one of the most flexible and thematically rich classes in the entire game.
