# Priest  
### Tier 1 Base Class – Echo of the Seven

Priests are spiritual mediators, healers, and channelers of divine radiance.  
They mend wounds, protect allies, dispel corruption, and deliver righteous judgement when needed.  
A Priest’s power flows not from muscle or arcane study — but from **faith, devotion and spiritual resonance**.

A Priest is not merely a healer.  
They are the light that refuses to fade.
