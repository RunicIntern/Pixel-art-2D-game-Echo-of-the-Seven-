# Class Overview  
### Echo of the Seven – Core Class System (Tier 1 → Tier 4)

Echo of the Seven features a flexible and deeply customizable class system built around **five base classes**.  
Each hero begins with a clear identity and playstyle, but every major milestone transforms that identity into something new.  

Classes evolve, merge and specialize across four tiers, allowing players to shape their character through:

- class combinations,  
- rune mastery,  
- divine alignment,  
- racial affinity,  
- personal playstyle choices.

This creates a system where **every build can feel unique**.

# 🟦 Tier 1 – Base Classes (Levels 1–10)

Every new character begins with one of the five primary archetypes:

- **Warrior** – frontline fighter, discipline, physical force  
- **Priest** – healer/support, holy or spiritual arts  
- **Mage** – elemental magic, arcane power, battlefield control  
- **Rogue** – stealth, poisons, mobility, precision killing  
- **Hunter** – ranged physical DPS, traps, nature instincts, positioning

Each Tier 1 class includes:

- 6 foundational abilities  
- 1 long-duration class buff (unlocked at level 5)  
- A distinct combat role and difficulty curve  
- Clear identity and synergy with other classes

These serve as the **building blocks** of later evolutions.

# 🟩 Tier 2 – Class Evolutions (Level 10)

At level 10, the player unlocks their first **Class Evolution** by combining their primary class with one secondary Tier 1 class.

Each combination produces one unique Tier 2 class.

### Current Tier 2 combinations:

- **Warrior + Priest → Paladin**  
- **Warrior + Rogue → Berserker**  
- **Warrior + Mage → Battlemage**  
- **Warrior + Hunter → Warden**

- **Rogue + Priest → Shaman**  
- **Rogue + Mage → Spellblade**  
- **Rogue + Hunter → Assassin Ranger**

- **Priest + Mage → Oracle**  
- **Priest + Hunter → Spirit Ranger**

- **Mage + Hunter → Druid**

Each Tier 2 class gains:

- 6 new core abilities (replacing or enhancing T1 kit)  
- a unique class mechanic or resource  
- new playstyle-defining passives  
- deeper synergy with rune categories

Tier 2 is where **build fantasy truly begins**.

# 🟨 Tier 3 – Advanced Mutations (Level 30)

Tier 3 introduces **mutations**, an evolution system where abilities begin to adapt based on:

- class identity,  
- divine alignment,  
- rune expertise,  
- the player’s consistent use of certain skills.

Tier 3 mutations:

- modify 1–3 core abilities,  
- enhance signature skills,  
- unlock thematic specializations,  
- begin bridging the gap toward the final form (Tier 4).

### Examples:

- A Shaman aligned with **Luminara** gains radiant healing through spiritual spells.  
- A Berserker aligned with **Ignovar** ignites rage abilities with fire bursts.  
- A Druid aligned with **Seranthis** manifests storm-charged transformations.  
- An Oracle aligned with **Archivion** gains predictive “echo-casts.”

Tier 3 is where a build becomes **personal and unique**.

---

# 🟥 Tier 4 – Apex Ascension (Level 50)

Tier 4 is the peak of progression — a character’s **Apex Form**.

Apex reflects:

- their base class,  
- Tier 2 evolution,  
- Tier 3 mutations,  
- rune choices,  
- divine alignment,  
- race identity,  
- personal build path.

Two players who chose the same Tier 2 class will still likely end up drastically different by Tier 4.

Examples:

- An **Orc Priest → Paladin** aligned with **Aerendel** becomes a dark-light hybrid CC tank.  
- An **Elf Mage → Druid** aligned with **Seranthis** becomes a storm-wild shapeshifter.  
- A **Dwarf Warrior → Battlemage** aligned with **Dul’Mora** becomes a rune-armoured juggernaut.

Tier 4 is where gameplay becomes **epic**, thematic and fully build-defining.

# ⚔ Class Synergy System

Synergy in Echo of the Seven exists at three layers:

---

## 1. **Class-to-Class Synergy**
Some pairings naturally complement each other:

- Warrior benefits from Priest’s shielding.  
- Mage loves Rogue's control windows.  
- Hunter amplifies Shaman’s nature abilities.  
- Druid and Warden create excellent AoE control teams.

---

## 2. **Rune Synergy**
Each class gains specific benefits from rune **categories**, not rune words.

Categories include:

- impact,  
- frost,  
- fire,  
- stealth,  
- nature,  
- spirit,  
- lightning,  
- protection,  
- precision,  
- control.

Players must **discover exact rune words in-game**, maintaining mystery and exploration.

---

## 3. **Divine Synergy**
Deities don’t restrict your class — they **influence** it.

Alignment grants thematic bonuses:

- **Luminara** – holy healing, radiant empowerment  
- **Ignovar** – fire, rage, momentum  
- **Archivion** – echoes, knowledge, arcane  
- **Seranthis** – storms, change, nature  
- **Aerendel** – shadow, distance, manipulation  
- **Dul’Mora** – earth, stone, resilience  
- **Umbros** – darkness, tricks, forbidden power

The best builds come from creative, sometimes unusual combinations.

# 🧬 Race Interaction

Races do NOT give power advantages — but **identity bonuses** that enhance flavour:

- **Orcs:** physical control, grit, stubborn endurance  
- **Elves:** agility, magical affinity, nature instinct  
- **Dwarves:** craftsmanship, durability, firearm mastery  
- **Humans:** flexibility, adaptability, mixed synergy  
- **Beastfolk:** primal senses, strong Tier 3 mutations  
- **Goblins:** traps, mechanical tricks, chaotic creativity  
- **Undead:** resilience to debuffs, shadow affinity, unique resistances  

These bonuses reshape gameplay *subtly*, without breaking balance.

---
