# Class Overview  
### Echo of the Seven – Core Class System (Tier 1 → Tier 4)

Echo of the Seven offers a flexible, progression-driven class system built around **five base classes**.  
Each class begins with its own identity, combat style and six core abilities, but none of them are “locked in forever”.  
At level milestones, classes evolve, merge and transform into **powerful hybrid archetypes**, allowing players to shape their hero in unique directions.

---

## 🟦 The Five Base Classes (Tier 1)
Every new character begins by choosing one of the five primary archetypes:

- **Warrior** – frontline fighter, defense, strength, close-range combat  
- **Priest** – healer, support, holy magic, blessings  
- **Mage** – ranged caster, elemental magic, control  
- **Rogue** – assassin, stealth, mobility, damage-over-time  
- **Hunter** – ranged physical dps, traps, nature, precision  

These five form the foundation of all future class evolutions.

Each class starts with:
- **6 core abilities**,  
- a unique combat role,  
- distinct synergy with races, runes, and divine domains.

---

## 🟩 Level 10 – Class Evolutions (Tier 2)
At level 10, players unlock the first major milestone:  
**Class Evolutions**, created by merging traits from two Tier 1 classes.

Examples:
- **Warrior + Priest → Paladin**  
- **Rogue + Priest → Shaman**  
- **Mage + Rogue → Spellblade**  
- **Warrior + Mage → Battlemage**  
- **Mage + Priest → Oracle**  
- **Warrior + Rogue → Berserker**

These evolutions unlock new abilities, new passive bonuses and set each character on a long-term path.

---

## 🟨 Level 30 – Advanced Mutations (Tier 3)
At level 30, classes unlock a second transformative stage called **Advanced Mutations**.

These mutations:
- heavily alter 1–2 core abilities,  
- specialize the playstyle,  
- unlock deeper synergy with runes,  
- bring the first *domain-aligned bonuses* depending on the deity the player follows.

Example idea:
- A Shaman who follows **Luminara** gains radiant healing to his spirit abilities.  
- A Berserker who follows **Ignovar** gains fire-charged rage bursts.  
- An Oracle who follows **Archivion** gains echo effects on spells.

---

## 🟥 Level 50 – Apex Ascension (Tier 4)
At level 50, every class reaches its **Apex Form**.  
This is the final evolution, a culmination of:

- chosen class path,  
- selected runes,  
- race bonuses,  
- mutations,  
- divine alignment.

The player’s final form can be **radically different** even within the same class—  
for example, an Orc Priest → Paladin → Shadow-bound Paladin aligned with Aerendel, gaining extreme CC and dark-light hybrid magic.

This makes every endgame build personal, unique, and narrative-driven.

---

## ⚔ Class Synergy System
Synergy exists at three levels:

### 1. **Class-to-Class Synergy**
Certain class combinations naturally complement each other—  
for example, a Warrior benefits from a Priest’s buffs, or a Rogue amplifies a Mage’s burst cycles.

### 2. **Rune Synergy**
Each class interacts differently with the **Echo Runic System**.  
Runes enhance or modify abilities depending on:
- the runic word,
- domain origin,
- class affinity.

### 3. **Divine Synergy**
Choosing a deity doesn’t restrict the class—  
**but grants powerful bonuses if aligned thematically**.

Examples:
- A Paladin aligned with **Luminara** gains stronger healing and holy shielding.  
- A Hunter aligned with **Aerendel** becomes faster, more evasive and gains enhanced movement skills.  
- A Shaman aligned with **Umbros** can speak to darker spirits and manipulate illusions.

Players remain free to mix unorthodox choices—  
and sometimes the strongest builds come from unexpected combinations.

---

## 🧬 Race Interaction
Races do not restrict class choices, but **each race has a natural affinity** that subtly shapes gameplay:

- Orcs: strength, fury, durability  
- Elves: precision, mana flow, mobility  
- Dwarves: metal, crafting, fortitude  
- Humans: balance, adaptability  
- Beastfolk: primal instincts, spirit links  
- Goblins: trickery, scavenging, agility  
- Fallen/Undead: shadow, curses, resilience to debuffs  

These affinities shine strongest in the **Tier 3 and Tier 4 evolutions**, but never block the player from pursuing any fantasy they want.

---

## Summary
Echo of the Seven offers a class system built on:

- freedom,  
- synergy,  
- meaningful evolution,  
- and narrative identity.

Five base classes open the path,  
class evolutions shape the journey,  
and the combination of runes, races and divine domains  
creates **limitless endgame possibilities**.
