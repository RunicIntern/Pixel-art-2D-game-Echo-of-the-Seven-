# Mage  
### Tier 1 Base Class – Echo of the Seven

Mages are masters of elemental destruction and arcane manipulation.  
They command fire, frost, lightning and spatial echoes to obliterate enemies, control the battlefield, and unleash devastating magic.

In Echo of the Seven, a Mage doesn’t merely cast spells — they bend the fabric of reality using runic channels infused into their mana.

## 🔮 Class Identity  
**Combat Role:** Ranged Magic DPS / Elementalist / AoE Control  
**Difficulty:** ★★★★☆  
**Resource:** Mana (fast regen, high cost abilities)  
**Armor Type:** Cloth / Light Arcane Robes  
**Primary Attributes:** Intelligence, Will, Mastery

---

## 🧬 Lore  
Mages of Aurion are intellectual warriors — scholars of the arcane who devoted their lives to studying elemental harmonics, ley-line flows and remnants of ancient runic power.

Each Mage specializes in one of several paths:

- **Ignovar Mages** – fire, eruption, destruction  
- **Seranthis Mages** – lightning, chaos, unstable magic  
- **Aerendel Mages** – wind, teleportation, speed  
- **Archivion Mages** – memory, echo magic, knowledge  
- **Luminara Mages** – light spells, barriers, radiant control  

Unlike Priests who channel divine essence, Mages reshape the world through willpower alone — but their magic is volatile and dangerous.

## 🩸 Strengths & Weaknesses

### ✔ Strengths  
- Highest burst damage in the game  
- Strong AoE and crowd-control  
- Tons of rune interactions  
- Teleports, mobility and battlefield control

## 🌀 Synergy With Runes  
Mages are the MOST runic-dependent class in the entire game.

Top rune synergies:

- **RA** – fire, eruption, burn  
- **EL** – lightning, stuns, overload  
- **NAL** – frost, slow, freeze  
- **AEL** – space, teleportation, blink  
- **MEL** – clarity, mana efficiency  
- **SER** – chaos procs (crit explosions)

Hybrid spell examples:  
- RA + SER → chaotic fire explosions  
- EL + MEL → chain lightning with clarity boosts  
- NAL + ZYN → slow → freeze → shatter combos  
- AEL + RA → teleport → fiery explosion from arrival point  

Mages convert runes into completely new variants of spells.

## 🧬 Best Race Synergies  
All races can cast, but some excel naturally:

### ⭐ **Elf**  
Best mana regen + accuracy → top-tier caster.

### ⭐ **Human**  
Balanced stats → great for hybrid Mage evolutions (Oracle, Battlemage).

### ⭐ **Fallen/Undead**  
Dark magic affinity → shadow caster builds.

### ⭐ **Goblin**  
Insane chaos builds with Seranthis + EL.

### ⭐ **Beastfolk**  
Surprising synergy: nature-frost hybrid builds.
