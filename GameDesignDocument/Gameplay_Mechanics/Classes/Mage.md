# Mage  
### Tier 1 Base Class – Echo of the Seven

Mages are wielders of elemental force and echo-infused arcane power.  
They manipulate fire, frost, lightning and spatial distortion, controlling the battlefield from a safe distance.  
Fragile but devastating, a Mage bends reality through knowledge, focus and precision casting.

A Mage understands the world not as it is — but as it *could be reshaped*.

# 🎯 Class Identity  
**Combat Role:** Ranged Magic DPS / Control / Utility  
**Difficulty:** ★★★☆☆  
**Resource:** Mana  
**Armor:** Cloth  
**Primary Attributes:** Intellect, Willpower, Control

---

# 🧬 Lore & Theme  
Mages are scholars, researchers, battlecasters and echo-channelers.  
They study fragments of ancient magical disciplines left after the Cataclysm and push those powers to modern form.

Their craft resonates with domains of:

- **fire and destruction**,  
- **frost and slowing**,  
- **storms and arcane resonance**,  
- **space and rifts**,  
- **knowledge and structure**.

A Mage is both a scientist and a weapon — depending on how they channel the echoes.

# 🔎 Tier 1 Special Exploration Skill  
### **Waygate Recall**  
*Mage-only spatial travel skill.*

Mages can manipulate spatial echoes to teleport to previously attuned locations.

# 🛠 Tier 3 Skill Mutation (Preview)

At Level 30, frequently used spells begin to mutate based on usage, rune categories and deity alignment.

Examples:
- **Firebolt** → gains splash or burning-over-time variants  
- **Ice Shard** → may root briefly or ricochet  
- **Blink** → may create an afterimage or leave slowing residue  
- **Arcane Pulse** → may amplify nearby magic or stagger  
- **Elemental Surge** → unlocks alternate cast behaviour (instant but weaker, or charged but stronger)

Deity examples:
- **Seranthis** → storm-flavoured surges  
- **Archivion** → echo effects or mirrored casts  
- **Ignovar** → high-risk fire empowerment  

Tier 3 mutations define mid-game identity.

# 🛤 Tier 2 Evolution (Level 10)

A Mage can merge with any other Tier 1 class to create a unique hybrid:

### ⚔️ Mage + Warrior → **Battlemage**  
Armoured caster using melee-arcane blends and empowered strikes.

### 🗡️ Mage + Rogue → **Spellblade**  
Illusion tricks, imbued weapons, spatial manipulation.

### ✝️ Mage + Priest → **Oracle**  
Divination magic, foresight, support spells, echo-reading.

### 🍃 Mage + Hunter → **Druid**  
Nature channeling, hybrid storm/earth/wild magic, shapeshift-like casting.

Each hybrid significantly changes playstyle and resource interactions.
