# 🔮 Mage Fantasy – “How It Feels to Play”

Playing Mage feels like:

- tearing reality open with raw magic,  
- freezing enemies in place,  
- vanishing in a blink and reappearing at a safe angle,  
- landing huge elemental surges at just the right time,  
- feeling powerful yet fragile — glass cannon with a brain.

A living storm.  
A scholar of power.  
A hand that rewrites the rules of the battlefield.
