# 🧬 Lore & Theme  
Warriors are the backbone of armies, mercenary companies and royal guards.  
They trust steel more than sorcery and rely on training, discipline and raw endurance.

Their fighting style resonates with domains of:

- strength and impact,  
- protection and fortification,  
- honour and duty,  
- controlled fury.

They are not spellcasters — but their presence on the battlefield is a kind of magic in itself.
