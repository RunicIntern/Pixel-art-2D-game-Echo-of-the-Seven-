# Warrior  
### Tier 1 Base Class – Echo of the Seven

The Warrior is the unbreakable frontline of any party — a master of steel, grit and battlefield control.  
Warriors dominate close-range combat, protecting allies, disrupting enemies and delivering crushing blows through raw strength and tactical precision.

In Echo of the Seven, Warriors channel their physical might through the Echo Runic System, enabling powerful weapon enhancements and defensive echoes.

## 🧬 Lore  
Warriors are the backbone of Aurion’s armies — knights, mercenaries, wanderers, clan champions and city guardians.  
Unlike mages or priests, Warriors do not rely on arcane mastery or divine blessings. Their power comes from:

- discipline,  
- training,  
- resilience,  
- and an unbreakable will.

However, Warriors have learned to wield runes **through steel**.  
Their weapons and armour bear etchings of:

- **VAR** (strength),  
- **VOL** (protection),  
- **SHAR** (steel edge),  
- **RA** (fire forging),  
- **TYR** (blood and battle).

This binding of physical combat + runic echoes created a modern Warrior capable of much more than brute force.
