# Hunter  
### Tier 1 Base Class – Echo of the Seven

Hunters are masters of precision, instinct and wilderness survival.  
They excel at long-range combat, tactical positioning, battlefield control and reading the environment better than any other class.

A Hunter does not simply fight enemies — they **predict** them.

---

# 🎯 Class Identity  
**Combat Role:** Ranged Physical DPS / Kiting / Trap Control  
**Difficulty:** ★★★☆☆  
**Resource:** Focus (generated by attacks, spent on empowered skills)  
**Armor:** Leather / Light Armour  
**Primary Attributes:** Agility, Precision, Focus

---

# 🧬 Lore & Theme  
Hunters stand between wilderness and civilisation.  
They are scouts, wardens, trackers and sharpshooters who live by instinct rather than doctrine.

A Hunter’s knowledge comes from:
- wind currents,  
- animal behaviour,  
- terrain flow,  
- scent,  
- shadows,  
- sound.

While Hunters rarely bind themselves to a single deity, their craft resonates with:

- **wind and movement**,  
- **storms and instinct**,  
- **nature’s hunt**,  
- **bleeds and traps**,  
- **spiritual harmony with the wild**.

They learn from the world — not from scripture.

# 🌲 Hunter Fantasy – “How It Feels to Play”

Hunter gameplay is about:

- striking from unreachable distance,  
- weaving traps, bleeds and elemental shots,  
- flowing through terrain with perfect kiting,  
- predicting enemy movement before it happens,  
- controlling the battlefield instead of reacting to it.

A silent arrow.  
A whisper in the wind.  
A predator shaped by instinct and mastery.
