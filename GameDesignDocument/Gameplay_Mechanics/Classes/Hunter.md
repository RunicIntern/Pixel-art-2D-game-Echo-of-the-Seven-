# Hunter  
### Tier 1 Base Class – Echo of the Seven

Hunters are masters of precision, instinct and wilderness survival.  
They excel at long-range combat, tactical positioning, kiting enemies and controlling the battlefield with traps.

A Hunter reads the world like a map — wind direction, animal movement, terrain, shadows. Nothing goes unnoticed.

# 🧬 Lore & Theme  
Hunters serve as scouts, trackers and wardens of the wild places of Aurion.  
They move between civilisation and wilderness, living by instinct and understanding of terrain.

Although not bound to a single deity, Hunters resonate with domains involving:

- wind, movement and sudden strikes,  
- storms and instinct,  
- nature and bleeding prey,  
- stability and trapcraft,  
- spiritual harmony with the land.

Hunters learn from the world — not from scripture.
