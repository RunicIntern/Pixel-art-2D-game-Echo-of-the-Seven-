## 🧬 Lore  
Hunters are the wardens of Aurion’s wild places.  
They are scouts, trackers, beast tamers and sharpshooters — always one step ahead of the enemy.

While they rarely swear loyalty to any single deity, their craft often aligns with:

- **Seranthis** (storm, chaos, sudden strikes),  
- **Aerendel** (wind, distance, movement),  
- **Dul’Mora** (stone traps, stability),  
- **Luminara** (holy arrows, protective marks).

Hunters live between civilisation and wilderness, reading tracks, sensing danger, and striking from unexpected angles.
