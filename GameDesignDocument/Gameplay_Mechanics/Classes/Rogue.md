# Rogue  
### Tier 1 Base Class – Echo of the Seven

They excel at attacking from the shadows, exploiting weak points and controlling fights through poisons, debuffs and tricks.

**Difficulty:** ★★★★☆  
**Resource:** Energy (fast-regenerating) + Combo Points

# 🧬 Lore & Theme  

Rogues are:

- thieves, spies, assassins, scouts and infiltrators,  
- operating where honourable methods fail,  
- relying on timing, positioning and information.

They resonate thematically with:

- shadows and misdirection,  
- poisons and slow killing,  
- precision and critical hits,  
- traps and sabotage.

They are as dangerous in alleys and courts as on a battlefield.

# 🕶 Rogue Fantasy – “How It Feels to Play”

Playing Rogue feels like:

- always looking for the weak spot,  
- striking when it hurts most,  
- vanishing before enemies react,  
- poisoning, tripping and outsmarting opponents,  
- being the unseen blade that changes the outcome of a fight.

A whisper in the dark.  
A knife between the ribs.  
A problem that enemies never see coming.
