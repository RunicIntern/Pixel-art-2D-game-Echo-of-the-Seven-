# Rogue  
### Tier 1 Base Class – Echo of the Seven

Rogues are assassins, infiltrators and masters of cunning.  
They specialize in stealth, poisons, precision strikes and battlefield manipulation.  
A Rogue thrives where others hesitate — in the dark corners, in the blind spots, in the split-second between action and reaction.

A Rogue sees opportunity where others see danger.

# 🧬 Lore & Theme  
Rogues exist in every city, every shadow and every battlefield of Aurion.

- **shadows and misdirection**,

A Rogue does not win through brute strength — they win through advantage.
