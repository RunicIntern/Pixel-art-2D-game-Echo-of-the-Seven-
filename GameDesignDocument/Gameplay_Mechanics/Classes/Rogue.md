# Rogue  
### Tier 1 Base Class – Echo of the Seven

The Rogue is the silent blade in the dark — unseen, unpredictable, and deadly.  
Masters of stealth, poisons, critical strikes and battlefield manipulation, Rogues excel at eliminating key targets, reducing enemy defenses and creating chaos in enemy lines.

In Echo of the Seven, the Rogue blends agility, shadowcraft and trickery with the Echo Runic System to become a lethal assassin or an evasive skirmisher.

## 🧬 Lore  
Rogues live between shadow and survival.  
Some work as scouts, thieves or assassins; others serve kingdoms as spies or covert agents.  
A Rogue’s connection to magic is subtle — not arcane, but instinctual:

- They manipulate **shadows (Umbros)** to hide or confuse.  
- They harness **chaos runes (Seranthis)** for unpredictable attacks.  
- They empower blades with **SHAR** to pierce armor.  
- They use **ETH** for mobility and fast repositioning.

Rogues are not inherently evil — they are simply the invisible force that shapes events from the shadows.
