# Guardians – Nature, Role and Function

## Introduction
The Guardians are seven ancient beings created by the Ancient Kings long before the Runic Cataclysm. Their original purpose was to maintain balance between the primal domains and prevent conflicts that could destabilise the foundation of the world.

After the Cataclysm they survived only as diminished echoes of their former power. Although weakened, unstable, and detached from their original domains, they remain the last living witnesses of the old world and play a central role in the narrative of *Echo of the Seven*.

## Physical Nature and Appearance
In their true form, the Guardians resembled massive troll-like giants with human features: towering, powerful, intelligent and enduring. They were capable of great physical feats, acting as both wardens and interpreters of the Ancient Kings’ domains.

After the Runic Cataclysm, however, their bodies became unstable. To remain hidden within the new civilisations of Aurion, each Guardian learned to adopt a fully humanoid appearance. They may take the form of:

- a human,
- an elf or dwarf,
- an orc or half-blood,
- a wandering drunk,
- a stable-hand,
- a court jester,
- or an unremarkable clerk.

Unless they choose to reveal themselves, **there is no visible way to distinguish a Guardian from any ordinary inhabitant**.

## Current State and Limitations
The Guardians survived the destruction of the Runic Crystal, but at great cost:

- their physical strength is greatly reduced,
- they cannot use their former domain powers,
- their essence is unstable and can shift between forms,
- they can observe but rarely intervene directly.

Nevertheless, they still retain limited insight into the world, fragments of ancient knowledge, and the ability to bestow a single powerful gift upon a worthy hero.

## Echo Form – Visions, Dreams and Runic Traces
Although capable of assuming a physical body, the Guardians can also appear as **Echo Forms**:

- flickering silhouettes,
- runic impressions in the air,
- whispers heard only by one person,
- dream-visions,
- or brief distortions of space and light.

The Echo Form is their safest means of communication. It allows them to pass information, warnings, hints or guidance without exposing their true identity or location.

## When Do Guardians Appear? (Rare + Narrative + Semi-Random)
Meetings with Guardians follow a three-layer system:

### 1. Rare Encounters
Guardians do not reveal themselves casually. Most inhabitants will live and die without ever encountering one in person.

### 2. Narrative Triggers
A Guardian will take interest when the balance of a region shifts or when a player performs notable actions such as:

- defeating a powerful creature (e.g., a Mountain Troll),
- resolving a runic anomaly,
- influencing political or social structures,
- raising reputation in a city or faction,
- uncovering knowledge tied to ancient domains.

### 3. Semi-Random Factors
Guardians travel, observe and adapt.  
Thus, their encounters may vary between players:

- one might meet a Guardian early,
- another much later,
- some only through visions,
- some directly in physical form.

This system keeps the world dynamic and unpredictable.

## Interaction With the World – Reputation and Consequences
Guardians react not to the player’s level, but to **their influence on the world**.  
As the player completes significant deeds, rumours spread through towns, taverns and trade routes.

In response:

- shop prices may change,
- NPC behaviour evolves,
- new dialogue options appear,
- and a Guardian may begin to observe the player closely.

A Guardian who once ignored the player may suddenly shift attention, speak through a dream, or reveal themselves under a mundane disguise.

## Trials of the Guardians – Echo Skills (Level 50)
Each Guardian retains the ability to grant **an Echo of their former domain** — a powerful skill available only at level 50.

This gift is never granted lightly.

### 1. Complex Trials
Each Guardian tests a different aspect of the player:

- courage,
- resilience,
- empathy,
- wisdom,
- runic understanding,
- tactical awareness,
- or moral character.

Trials may be:

- puzzles,
- moral choices,
- combat challenges,
- exploratory tasks,
- or sequences of visions.

### 2. Player Choice
After the trials, the player selects the form of Echo they wish to receive.  
The Guardian may:

- accept the choice,
- reject it,
- or offer an alternative based on the trials’ outcome.

This system ensures personalisation and narrative impact.

---

## Can Guardians Die?
In the base game: **no**.

Their true essence is bound to the remnants of the ancient domains, and their final death would destabilise Aurion once more. While they can vanish, weaken, be sealed away or fall into deep slumber, none can be permanently killed before future expansions.

Their ultimate fate is tied to long-term narrative arcs.

---

## Summary
The Guardians are:

- the last living shadows of the ancient era,  
- wanderers hidden in plain sight,  
- judges of character rather than power,  
- unpredictable but fair,  
- catalysts of major story events,  
- and the source of the rare, powerful Echo Domain abilities at level 50.

They bridge the old world and the new, guiding the player toward a future shaped by the echoes of the past.
