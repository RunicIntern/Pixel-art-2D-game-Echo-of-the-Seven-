# The Ancient Kings – Pantheon Overview

## Introduction
Long before recorded history, Aurion was shaped and governed by the Seven Ancient Kings. These beings were not gods in the mortal sense, but primal forces given form: embodiments of the fundamental domains that defined the structure of the world.

Their unity created the first age of harmony.  
Their rivalry destroyed it.

The Ancient Kings perished during the Runic Cataclysm, their essence fragmented into millions of runes. Although long gone, their influence can still be felt in every region, creature and anomaly across Aurion.

## Nature of the Ancient Kings
The Ancient Kings were:

- immortal but not infallible,  
- powerful but not omnipotent,  
- creators but also destroyers,  
- bound to their domains yet capable of reshaping them at will.

Each King personified a concept essential to the world’s structure. Their knowledge was absolute within their domain, but their personalities were flawed – leading to tension, ambition and rivalry.

Their physical forms were massive, radiant and barely comprehensible to mortals. Only the Guardians and certain early civilisations ever saw them directly.

## The Seven Domains
Below is an overview of the seven primordial domains and the Kings who ruled them.

---

## 1. **Aren-Thul, King of Time**
**Domain:** Time  
**Nature:** patient, calculating, introspective  
**Strengths:** control of cycles, ages and temporal stability  
**Flaws:** fatalistic, detached from the present  

Aren-Thul saw all possible futures and all forgotten pasts. His desire to preserve the “correct timeline” often clashed with other Kings, who rejected the idea of destiny. His warnings about the coming conflict were ignored.

---

## 2. **Vaeloria, Queen of Life**
**Domain:** Life  
**Nature:** nurturing, determined, protective  
**Strengths:** creation of flora, fauna, ecosystems  
**Flaws:** possessive, unable to accept natural death  

Vaeloria expanded life endlessly, filling Aurion with abundance. Yet she resisted any force that destroyed or corrupted life, creating friction with the King of Change and the King of Strength.

---

## 3. **Igralon, King of Creation**
**Domain:** Creation / Matter  
**Nature:** inventive, proud, visionary  
**Strengths:** shaping mountains, oceans, structures, artefacts  
**Flaws:** perfectionist, obsessed with legacy  

Igralon forged the physical world, crafting landscapes and materials. His rivalry with the King of Knowledge stemmed from conflicting ideas of what “perfect design” truly meant.

---

## 4. **Seryth, King of Change**
**Domain:** Change / Transformation  
**Nature:** unpredictable, philosophical, curious  
**Strengths:** metamorphosis, evolution, natural adaptation  
**Flaws:** impulsive, destructive experimentation  

Seryth believed that nothing should remain constant. His domain clashed with Vaeloria’s stability and Aren-Thul’s cycles, creating the first cracks in the unity of the pantheon.

---

## 5. **Melyon, King of Knowledge**
**Domain:** Knowledge  
**Nature:** analytical, relentless, obsessive  
**Strengths:** understanding of runes, laws, origins  
**Flaws:** arrogance, desire for absolute truth at any cost  

Melyon was the first to discover concepts beyond the world itself. His pursuit of forbidden truths isolated him from the others – and ultimately led to the creation of the Runic Crystal.

---

## 6. **Korveth, King of Strength**
**Domain:** Strength / Force  
**Nature:** resolute, tactical, protective  
**Strengths:** physical power, martial law, defence  
**Flaws:** stubbornness, aggression, pride  

Korveth maintained balance through might. He opposed Seryth’s chaotic changes and refused to let Vaeloria interfere with natural struggle and survival.

---

## 7. **Elyndor, King of Space**
**Domain:** Space / Boundaries / Paths  
**Nature:** calm, distant, enigmatic  
**Strengths:** dimensional integrity, pathways, distance  
**Flaws:** emotionally detached, slow to act  

Elyndor shaped the borders of the world and maintained the structure of reality. His neutrality made him the mediator among the Kings – until even he could no longer contain the growing conflict.

---

## Relations and Conflicts
Though united by purpose, the Ancient Kings diverged in philosophy:

- **Life vs. Change** – preservation against transformation  
- **Strength vs. Knowledge** – instinct against logic  
- **Time vs. Creation** – stability against reconstruction  
- **Space vs. All** – mediator caught between opposing forces  

Small disagreements grew into ideological rifts. Each King believed their interpretation of balance was correct.

Melyon’s research into runic essence revealed a potential method to combine the Seven Domains into one perfect source of power – a concept that terrified some Kings and fascinated others.

This disagreement became the spark that ignited the final conflict.

---

## Creation of the Guardians
As tensions escalated, the Kings created seven powerful beings – the Guardians – entrusted with maintaining the balance they could no longer sustain themselves.

Each Guardian was tied to one domain and served as:

- interpreter,  
- enforcer,  
- and stabiliser  

of its cosmic laws.

When the Kings’ conflict reached its peak, the Guardians became the only remaining voices of reason – but they lacked authority to stop their creators.

---

## The Runic Crystal and the Cataclysm
Melyon, King of Knowledge, secretly forged the **Runic Crystal**: a colossal artefact designed to unify the Seven Domains and end the growing conflict.

Instead, the crystal absorbed:

- the power,  
- the essence,  
- and the identities  

of all Seven Kings.

Unable to contain the combined force, it shattered violently – scattering fragments across the world.

This event became known as the **Runic Cataclysm**, marking the end of the Ancient Kings and the beginning of the Age of Echoes.

---

## Legacy and Influence
Though the Ancient Kings are gone, their legacy persists:

- their essence became runes,  
- their domains influence modern regions,  
- their echoes appear in anomalies,  
- their fragmented memories distort visions and dreams,  
- and entire religions formed around misunderstood encounters with Guardians.

The world of Aurion is built atop the ruins of their era, and the resurgence of Echo Runes suggests that their influence – or their enemies – may one day return.

---

## Summary
The Ancient Kings were:

- the creators of the world,  
- the first rulers of balance,  
- flawed beings of immense power,  
- the cause of the Cataclysm,  
- and the origin of all runic magic.

Their death reshaped Aurion forever.  
Their legacy defines the present age.  
And their Echoes may yet reshape the future.
