# Pantheon of Modern Gods  
*The contemporary religions of Aurion, born after the Runic Cataclysm*


## Introduction

After the Runic Cataclysm, the knowledge of the Ancient Kings was lost.  
The Guardians, weakened and fractured, hid among the mortal races in humanoid form.  
Echo Runes triggered visions, dreams and magical anomalies that mortals could not understand.

In the chaos that followed, people created their own interpretations of divine power.  
Thus emerged the **Modern Pantheon** — not a set of real gods, but a collection of:

- misinterpreted Guardian activity,  
- echoes of Runic anomalies,  
- strange visions caused by Echo Runes,  
- political manipulation by regional rulers,  
- and cultural myths developed over centuries.

It is important to note:

> **None of the Modern Gods are real.**  
> They are projections of mortal belief, fear and misunderstanding.

Each god dominates a particular region, but not rigidly:  
minor sects, heresies and underground cults exist everywhere, making the world feel alive rather than strictly divided.


# The Seven Modern Gods

## 1. Luminara – The Last Light  
**Type:** faith of hope, healing and harmony  
**Origin:** distorted sightings of the Guardian of Life

### Description
Luminara is worshipped as a goddess of:

- light,  
- rebirth,  
- healing,  
- inner balance.

Her priests build infirmaries, orphan houses and sanctuaries,  
believing that kindness can mend even a world broken by the Cataclysm.

### True Source
Not a goddess.  
Just echoes of the **Guardian of Life**, whose green regenerative aura is often seen during runic awakenings.

He tries to warn mortals.  
They mistake him for a deity.


## 2. Aerendel – The Father of Paths  
**Type:** orthodox church of law, structure and cartography  
**Origin:** distorted memories of Elyndor, Guardian of Space

### Description
Aerendel is revered as the god of:

- roads and pathways,  
- order and logic,  
- maps, geometry and measured knowledge.

His followers value structure, discipline and the rule of written law.

### True Source
Elyndor once tried to stabilise the collapsing world by shaping fractured space.  
These spatial “guiding lines” were later mythologised as divine intervention.

Aerendel is merely a cultural interpretation of Elyndor’s desperate actions.


## 3. Seranthis – The Stormmother  
**Type:** wild faith of tempest, mutation and primal nature  
**Origin:** runic anomalies tied to the Domain of Change

### Description
Seranthis is worshipped as a goddess of:

- storms,  
- lightning,  
- constant transformation,  
- natural chaos.

Her followers believe the world must never remain still — that rebirth requires destruction.

### True Source
Echoes of Seryth often manifest as lightning forming humanoid silhouettes in the sky.  
Mortals turned this phenomenon into a religion of storms.


## 4. Ignovar – The Burning Prince  
**Type:** war cult of strength, honour and fiery resolve  
**Origin:** Echo Runes tied to Korveth, King of Strength

### Description
Ignovar is the supposed god of:

- warriors,  
- gladiators,  
- blacksmiths,  
- internal fire and passion for battle.

His followers believe that truth is found in combat.

### True Source
Fragments of Korveth’s essence release bursts of red heat during runic surges.  
Mortals misinterpreted these events as divine fury.


## 5. Archivion – The One Who Remembers  
**Type:** scholarly cult of knowledge, history and destiny  
**Origin:** visions caused by Echo Runes of Knowledge (Melyon)

### Description
Archivion is honoured as the god of:

- books,  
- runes,  
- prophecy,  
- memory,  
- ancient truth.

His temples are libraries, archives and research halls.

### True Source
It is the lingering runic resonance of **Melyon**, not a deity.  
Mortals mistake fragments of his understanding for sacred prophecy.


## 6. Umbros / Umbravar – The Shadow King  
**Type:** mysterious cult of night, secrets and hidden truths  
**Origin:** echoes of the unstable Guardian of Time

### Description
Umbros represents:

- shadow,  
- dreams,  
- the unseen,  
- riddles and forgotten pathways.

His worshippers believe that truth is found in darkness rather than light.

### True Source
The Guardian of Time often appears as flickering shadows caused by temporal glitches.  
Mortals took these distortions as divine manifestations.


## 7. Dul’Mora – The Deepmother  
**Type:** subterranean religion of stone, magma and craftsmanship  
**Origin:** mutated caverns and anomalies left by the Domain of Creation

### Description
Dul’Mora is the deity of:

- caves and underground structures,  
- minerals and ores,  
- deep-fire forges,  
- craftsmanship and labour.

Worshipped by goblins, orcs, deep dwarves and ancient cave tribes.

### True Source
Igralon’s domain left behind vast distorted caverns and “living stone”.  
These anomalies became the foundation of Dul’Mora’s myth.


# Why the Modern Gods Matter

These religions shape:

- regional politics,  
- architecture and culture,  
- magical traditions,  
- monster behaviour,  
- social hierarchies,  
- and the overall identity of the world.

More importantly:

> Each Modern God is indirectly tied to a Guardian hiding in that region.

This connection fuels quests, conflicts and the world’s long-term narrative arc.


# Summary

The Modern Pantheon consists of:

- seven major faiths,  
- all based on misinterpreted Guardian activity,  
- each dominant in one region (but not rigidly),  
- forming the cultural, political and magical backbone of Aurion.

They are false gods born from a world shattered by truth.
