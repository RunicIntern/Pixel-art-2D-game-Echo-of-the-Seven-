# World Overview – Echo of the Seven

## Introduction
Echo of the Seven is set in Aurion, a fractured high-fantasy world shaped by the remnants of ancient divine powers. Once governed by the Seven Ancient Kings — primordial beings tied to fundamental domains of existence — Aurion was torn apart by a catastrophic event known as the Runic Cataclysm. The world that exists today is a fragile reconstruction, built atop echoes of ancient power, forgotten truths, and unstable magical forces.

Magic in Aurion is not a resource but a consequence: the natural by-product of shattered divine essence that permeates every region, creature, and civilisation. Its unpredictability is both a blessing and a threat, driving conflict, exploration, and the pursuit of long-lost knowledge.

## The Old World
Long before recorded history, Aurion thrived under the rule of the Seven Ancient Kings. These beings were not gods in the mortal sense, but creators — forces of immense power tied to domains such as Time, Life, Creation, Change, Knowledge, Strength and Space. Through their combined influence they shaped the land, created life, and forged the Seven Guardians: sentient beings tasked with maintaining balance.

Despite their power, the Ancient Kings were flawed. Ambition, pride and desire for dominance led to a growing conflict between them. Their domains clashed, destabilising the fabric of reality itself. In an attempt to end the conflict, one of the Kings created the Runic Crystal, a construct designed to unify their power. Instead, it absorbed them entirely and violently shattered, scattering their essence across the world.

## The Runic Cataclysm
The explosion of the Runic Crystal marks the greatest turning point in Aurion’s history. The Cataclysm obliterated the original kingdoms, warped the land, destabilised magic, and fragmented the divine essence into millions of shards now known as Runes.

These Runes vary in size and potency:
- **Lesser Runes:** small fragments used by mortals for enchantments, skills and crafting.
- **Greater Runes:** rare shards tied to forgotten domains.
- **Runic Anomalies:** unstable zones where divine energy behaves unpredictably.
- **Echo Runes:** extraordinarily rare fragments that still resonate with the memory of the Ancient Kings.

The Seven Guardians survived, but stripped of nearly all power. They became observers: timeless witnesses trapped between worlds, unable to act but still carrying hidden knowledge of what truly happened.

## The Age of Silence
Following the Cataclysm, Aurion entered an age of rebuilding. New races emerged from the remnants of old life, shaped by the runic energy saturating the world. Civilisations rose, fell, adapted and forgot. Knowledge of the Ancient Kings faded into myth as lesser beings tried to interpret the world around them.

During this period, weakened Guardians made rare contact with mortals. These encounters became the foundation for early religions. Over generations, rulers and high priests reshaped these fragmented truths into doctrines, eventually forming the **Modern Gods** — deities who are not truly divine but woven from reinterpretations of ancient encounters.

## The Modern Age
Aurion is now a world divided into seven great regions, each influenced by a dominant Runic Echo. Magical instability is common; creatures mutate, landscapes shift and certain areas become dangerous runic rifts. Civilisations survive through adaptation, cooperation, and — at times — exploitation of the lingering power.

The Modern Gods rule through temples, kingdoms and political influence, unaware (or uncaring) that their power is only a shadow of what once existed. Adventurers, scholars, shamans and warriors seek runes to gain power, wealth or understanding of the world.

## The Present Era – Age of Echoes
The game begins in a time when runic behaviour has once again started to change. Echo Runes resonate stronger than ever, anomalies appear more frequently, and one of the Guardians has mysteriously disappeared.

Whispers spread of individuals who can manipulate runes in ways unseen since the ancient world — individuals like the player.

The fragile balance of Aurion is shifting.  
Old truths resurface.  
New threats emerge.  
And the Echo of the Seven grows louder.
