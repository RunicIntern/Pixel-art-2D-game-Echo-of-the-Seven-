# Races Overview  
*Playable races of Aurion, shaped by the Runic Cataclysm*

---

## Introduction

The races of Aurion are **not** creations of gods.  
They were not forged by divine will nor transported from other realms.

Every playable race in Aurion emerged from:

- runic mutations after the Cataclysm,  
- remnants of ancient lifeforms,  
- the influence of Echo Runes,  
- environmental adaptation and cultural development.

Races differ in **history, culture, religion and visuals**,  
but **none of them provide gameplay bonuses**.  
Balance is preserved — class, runes and gear define power.

# 1. Humans  
**Dominant regions:** Luminara, Aerendel  
**Common deities:** Luminara, Aerendel, Archivion  
**Theme:** adaptable, ambitious, diverse

### Description
Humans rebuilt civilisation faster than any other race.  
They expand, trade, innovate and form both alliances and empires.

They are not the strongest nor the most durable,  
but they adapt to every environment and situation.

### Origin
Post-Cataclysm humanoids that survived within stable pockets of Time.

---

# 2. Elves  
**Dominant region:** Seranthis  
**Common deity:** Seranthis  
**Theme:** wild, storm-touched, unpredictable

### Description
Elves in Aurion are NOT noble, ethereal forest princes.  
They are the living reflection of the Domain of Change:

- swift,  
- emotional,  
- volatile,  
- deeply tied to nature’s storms.

Their culture embraces transformation, instinct and the raw power of the wild.

### Origin
Humanoid beings mutated by the storm-infused zones of Change.

# 3. Dwarves  
**Dominant region:** Dul’Mora  
**Common deity:** Dul’Mora  
**Theme:** stone, fire, craftsmanship, subterranean culture

### Description
Dwarves were shaped by the deep runic caverns and the remnants of the Creation domain.  
They excel in:

- metalworking,  
- stonecraft,  
- underground survival,  
- tradition and honour.

Hardy and stubborn, they thrive where others would perish.

### Origin
Mutated descendants of ancient underground lifeforms altered by Creation’s resonance.

---

# 4. Orcs  
**Dominant region:** Ignovar  
**Common deity:** Ignovar  
**Theme:** disciplined warriors, strength with purpose

### Description
Orcs in Aurion are not mindless berserkers.  
They value honour, structure and pragmatic strength.

Their society is built on:

- discipline,  
- respect,  
- clan hierarchy,  
- controlled ferocity.

### Origin
Evolved from humanoids exposed to Echo Runes of Strength (Korveth).

---

# 5. Goblins  
**Dominant regions:** scattered tribes across all lands  
**Common deities:** Dul’Mora, Umbros (varies by tribe)  
**Theme:** cunning, chaotic, inventive, comedic yet dangerous

### Description
Aurion’s goblins are **special**:

- brilliant improvisers,  
- mischievous tricksters,  
- explosive inventors,  
- scavengers of “precious junk”,  
- masters of traps and makeshift engineering.

Every goblin tribe has its own culture — some wild, others semi-civilised.

### Origin
Small-bodied survivors shaped by runic mutation and extreme adaptability.

**Goblins survive anywhere.**

---

# 6. Beastborn  
**Dominant regions:** wildlands and untamed territories  
**Common deities:** varies by tribe  
**Theme:** animalistic hybrids, tribal cultures, territory-driven

### Description
“Beastborn” is a collective term for numerous hybrid races:

- wolfborn clans,  
- bearfolk tribes,  
- feline huntresses,  
- lizardkin,  
- avian nomads,  
- and many more.

Each group has unique customs, strengths and conflicts.

### Origin
Strongly affected by the Domain of Change and runic storm zones.

---

# 7. Ghouls / The Fallen  
**Dominant regions:** Cataclysm-scarred zones  
**Common deity:** Umbros (often heretical cults)  
**Theme:** tragic, unstable, temporally scarred

### Description
Ghouls are not undead.  
They are victims of temporal distortion — beings trapped between “now” and decay.

They possess:

- extreme resilience,  
- disrupted pain response,  
- visible time-warp mutations,  
- fragmented memories.

They are feared, pitied, and misunderstood.

### Origin
Temporal anomalies born from the fractured Domain of Time.

---

# Removed Race: Runeborn (Design Choice)

Runeborn **are not a playable race**.

Instead, they serve as:

### ⭐ **World Mini-Bosses**
Found in areas of extreme runic instability.

Features:

- require a small party (3–5 players),  
- drop rare or powerful runes,  
- spawn adds based on rune type,  
- randomised runic buffs,  
- unpredictable behaviour changes mid-fight.

A perfect open-world challenge encounter.

# Race System Philosophy

- Races define **identity**, not power.  
- No stat bonuses or gameplay advantages.  
- Visuals, animations, lore and regional flavour differentiate each race.  
- Any race can choose any class.  
- Each race has its own starting zone and cultural introduction.

---

# Summary

Aurion’s playable races:

- emerged from runic mutation and environmental adaptation,  
- are culturally diverse and narrative-rich,  
- connect naturally to the Modern Gods and regional lore,  
- offer deep worldbuilding without affecting gameplay balance.

This structure keeps the world coherent, memorable and expandable.
