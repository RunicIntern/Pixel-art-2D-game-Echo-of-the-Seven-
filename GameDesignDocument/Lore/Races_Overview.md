# Races Overview  
*Playable races of Aurion, shaped by the Runic Cataclysm*

---

## Introduction

The races of Aurion are **not creations of gods**, nor remnants of other worlds.  
Every playable race emerged from:

- runic mutations after the Cataclysm,  
- remnants of ancient humanoids and beasts,  
- exposure to Echo-infused zones,  
- environmental adaptation and cultural evolution.

Races differ in **history, identity, religion and visual style**,  
but **none of them provide gameplay bonuses**.  

Balance is preserved — **class, runes and gear** define power, not species.

---

# 1. Humans  
**Dominant regions:** Luminara, Aerendel  
**Common deities:** Luminara, Aerendel, Archivion  
**Theme:** adaptable, ambitious, socially diverse

### Description
Humans rebuilt civilisation faster than any other race.  
They expand, innovate, trade and wage war with equal determination.

They are not naturally powerful nor magically gifted,  
but they thrive on **adaptation, creativity and resilience**.

### Origin
Descendants of post-Cataclysm survivors who lived within stable pockets of Time.

### Runic Synergy (General)
Humans exhibit broad, flexible compatibility with runic essence:

- they easily grasp *basic elemental and spiritual runes*,  
- interpret simple sequences,  
- and learn runic crafting through study or mentorship.

Advanced runes — especially those requiring deep intuition or spiritual alignment —  
demand **higher INT/WIL** or a magical class.  

Their strength lies in **versatility**, not specialization.

# 2. Elves  
**Dominant region:** Seranthis  
**Common deity:** Seranthis  
**Theme:** storm-touched, instinctive, nature-aligned

### Description
Elves in Aurion are NOT elegant forest nobles.  
They are the living embodiment of the **Domain of Change**:

- swift,  
- emotional,  
- volatile,  
- deeply attuned to nature’s storms and shifting energies.

Their culture embraces instinct, transformation and spiritual resonance.

### Origin
Humanoids heavily altered by storm-infused runic zones linked to the Domain of Change.

### Runic Synergy (General)
Elves attune naturally to:

- runes of nature and life,  
- harmony and growth patterns,  
- wind-like, flowing runic structures,  
- restorative and spiritual sequences.

They struggle with:

- rigid metallic runes,  
- chaotic destructive patterns lacking structure.

Elves often discover *high-tier healing or nature-aligned runes* earlier than others.

# 3. Dwarves  
**Dominant region:** Dul’Mora  
**Common deity:** Dul’Mora  
**Theme:** stone, fire, craftsmanship, subterranean kingdoms

### Description
Dwarves were reshaped by deep runic caverns and the remnants of Creation’s Domain.  
They excel in:

- metalwork and forge-craft,  
- stone shaping and engineering,  
- subterranean survival,  
- tradition, stubbornness and honour.

### Origin
Descendants of ancient cave-dwellers altered by Creation’s lingering resonance.

### Runic Synergy (General)
Dwarves resonate with:

- runes of metal, stone and stability,  
- reinforcement and fortification patterns,  
- fire and energy conduction.

However, they struggle with:

- illusions,  
- fluid or abstract arcane sequences,  
- unstable chaotic runes.

Dwarves are the best **runic smiths** in Aurion, even if not the best spellcasters.

# 4. Orcs  
**Dominant region:** Ignovar  
**Common deity:** Ignovar  
**Theme:** disciplined strength, battle tradition, controlled ferocity

### Description
Aurion’s orcs are not wild berserkers.  
They value:

- discipline,  
- honour,  
- structure,  
- purposeful strength.

Their society blends ritual combat with strict clan hierarchy.

### Origin
Humanoids evolved under intense exposure to strength-aligned Echo energies.

### Runic Synergy (General)
Orcs naturally connect with:

- battle and fury runes,  
- primal fire essence,  
- physical empowerment patterns.

They struggle with:

- subtle arcane symbols,  
- complex multi-step runic constructs,  
- harmony-based or highly intellectual patterns.

Orcs often require mentors, libraries or subclass evolution (e.g., shaman, paladin, battlemage) to unlock **high-tier runic meaning**.

---

# 5. Goblins  
**Dominant regions:** scattered tribes across Aurion  
**Common deities:** Dul’Mora, Umbros (varies by tribe)  
**Theme:** cunning, chaotic, inventive, comedic yet dangerous

### Description
Goblins of Aurion are:

- master improvisers,  
- mischievous tricksters,  
- explosive engineers,  
- scavengers of “precious junk”,  
- exceptional trapmakers and chemists.

Each tribe has unique customs — some feral, others surprisingly organised.

### Origin
Small, resilient survivors reshaped by runic mutation and extreme adaptability.

### Runic Synergy (General)
Goblins excel with:

- chaotic, unstable runes,  
- experimental energy patterns,  
- runes enhancing gadgets, traps and explosives.

They struggle with:

- divine, harmonious or spiritual runes,  
- calm restorative sequences.

Goblins frequently *use runes successfully without truly understanding them*, often with comedic or explosive consequences.

# 6. Beastborn  
**Dominant regions:** wildlands, untamed territories  
**Common deities:** varies by tribe  
**Theme:** animalistic hybrids, primal instinct, tribal societies

### Description
“Beastborn” is an umbrella term for multiple hybrid tribes:

- wolfborn hunters,  
- bearfolk warriors,  
- feline stalkers,  
- lizardkin mystics,  
- avian nomads,  
- and many more.

Each group has distinct traditions and behavioural patterns.

### Origin
Creatures reshaped by the Domain of Change and prolonged exposure to runic storms.

### Runic Synergy (General)
Beastborn attune naturally to:

- instinctive runes of blood, hunting and reflex,  
- movement and evasion patterns,  
- critical-strike or agility-enhancing symbols.

They struggle with:

- geometric arcane constructs,  
- deeply intellectual runes,  
- high-tier theoretical magic.

Their mastery comes from *instinct*, not scholarship.

# 7. Undead  
**Dominant regions:** shadowlands, ruined kingdoms, echo-scarred battlefields  
**Common deities:** Aerendel (Shadow), Mel’Thar (Echo)  
**Theme:** death-born resilience, fragmented identity, dark rebirth

### Description
Unlike the Fallen, **Undead are true revenants** — corpses revived through:

- shadow magic,  
- necromantic ritual,  
- or echo-bound resurrection.

They exist in preserved, decayed or partially reconstructed bodies,  
sustained by residual death essence.

Many retain fragments of memory or emotion;  
others drift through muted impulse and fading identity.

**Common traits:**

- resistance to disease and poison,  
- no natural metabolism,  
- darkvision,  
- increased resilience to pain,  
- vulnerability to holy magic,  
- strong spiritual resonance.

### Origin
Undead arise in regions saturated with death-aligned Echo residue:

- ancient battlefields,  
- collapsed necropolises,  
- cursed temples,  
- shadow-infested ruins.

Feared by the living, many still seek purpose — a second life, a lost memory, or a god willing to accept them.

### Runic Synergy (General)
Undead attune naturally to:

- runes of decay, shadow and entropy,  
- soul and death manipulation patterns,  
- time-fractured or echo-aligned sequences.

They struggle with:

- pure life or holy runes,  
- restorative harmonising symbols,  
- high-tier divine patterns.

Some require painful adaptations or ritual training to use “light-aligned” runes safely.

# Removed Race: Runeborn (Design Choice)

Runeborn **are not playable**.

They serve as:

### ⭐ World Mini-Bosses
Encountered in areas of extreme runic instability.

**Features:**

- designed for 3–5 players,  
- drop rare or powerful runes,  
- spawn adds based on rune category,  
- possess randomised runic buffs,  
- change behaviour mid-fight.

They act as dynamic open-world challenges and rare rune sources.

---

# Race System Philosophy

- Races define **identity**, not power.  
- No stat bonuses or gameplay advantages.  
- Visuals, lore and starting regions create identity — not mechanics.  
- Any race can choose any class.  
- Worldbuilding remains deep without harming balance.

---

# Summary

Aurion’s playable races:

- emerged from runic mutation and environmental adaptation,  
- reflect unique cultures and historical roots,  
- align naturally to different runic categories,  
- enrich the narrative without dictating gameplay strength.

This keeps the world coherent, memorable and endlessly expandable.
