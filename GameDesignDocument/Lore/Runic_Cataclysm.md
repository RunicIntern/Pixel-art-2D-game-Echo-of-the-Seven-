# Runic Cataclysm – Complete Lore Overview

## Introduction
The Runic Cataclysm marks the end of the Era of the Ancient Kings and the birth of the world as it exists today.  
It is the single most defining event in Aurion’s history, the source of:

- runes,
- modern magic,
- unstable anomalies,
- fractured landscapes,
- runic beasts,
- new races and civilisations,
- and the weakened, wandering Guardians.

The Cataclysm was not an accident, nor was it an act of malice.  
It was the **inevitable consequence of the collapse of the Seven Domains**,  
and the **final, conscious choice of two Kings who understood the truth.**


## The Rising Conflict – When Domains Began to Break
Each Ancient King embodied one of the seven fundamental forces of existence:

- Time  
- Life  
- Creation  
- Change  
- Knowledge  
- Strength  
- Space  

For ages these domains coexisted.  
But as their philosophies drifted apart, so did their stability:

### **Life vs. Change**  
Vaeloria sought preservation.  
Seryth demanded evolution.

### **Strength vs. Knowledge**  
Korveth followed instinct and tradition.  
Melyon trusted logic and understanding alone.

### **Time vs. Creation**  
Aren-Thul protected the cycle.  
Igralon rebuilt the world again and again.

### **Space vs. All**  
Elyndor attempted to mediate,  
but even his domain began to fracture under the strain.

The world trembled:  
mutations, time fractures, spatial distortions, and elemental instability spread across Aurion.

The domains could not coexist any longer.


## Melyon and Elyndor – The Last Two Who Understood
### **Melyon, King of Knowledge – the one who saw that collapse was inevitable**  
He did not act out of arrogance, madness, or ambition.  
He simply understood:

> **The world, as it existed, could not survive the war between Domains.**  
> The conflict would consume everything unless the system itself was rebuilt.

### **Elyndor, King of Space – the one who saw the boundaries breaking**  
He felt every rupture in reality.  
Every tear.  
Every fold.  
He understood that the world was coming apart — literally.

These two Kings, and only these two:

- remained rational,
- remained aware,
- and were capable of seeing beyond their personal domain.

This is why Melyon revealed his plan only to Elyndor.


## The Creation of the Runic Crystal
Melyon designed the Runic Crystal not as a weapon, but as a **solution** —  
a vessel capable of absorbing all seven domains and collapsing the conflict into a single point.

Its purpose:

- prevent the war of the Domains,
- end the imbalance,
- allow the world to be reborn in a stable form.

Elyndor opposed the idea at first.  
But when he witnessed the structural collapse of reality —  
tearing borders, twisted distances, spatial loops —  
he realised that no alternative remained.

Their alliance was not based on agreement.  
It was based on necessity.


## The Consumption of the Kings
When the Crystal activated, the Domains refused to merge peacefully.  
Inside the Crystal, they clashed violently — amplifying one another’s instability.

One by one, the Kings were consumed:

- **Aren-Thul (Time)** attempted to freeze the Crystal → absorbed.  
- **Vaeloria (Life)** tried to shield the others → overwhelmed.  
- **Korveth (Strength)** struck with full force → shattered instantly.  
- **Seryth (Change)** shifted form endlessly → swallowed regardless.  
- **Igralon (Creation)** attempted to forge a counter-force → too late.  

But the final two behaved differently:

### **Melyon walked into the Crystal willingly.**  
He did not resist.  
He accepted the outcome fully, believing a rebirth of the world was the only path forward.

### **Elyndor tried to save the world.**  
He attempted to teleport the Crystal beyond Aurion.  
Space tore apart under the strain.

He was consumed last.


## The Explosion – Birth of the Runic World
The Crystal could not contain the combined power of all seven domains.  
It detonated with a force strong enough to rewrite the world.

### Effects of the Cataclysm:
- continents fractured,  
- landscapes reshaped,  
- time distorted in several regions,  
- anomalies of space and matter appeared,  
- magical storms swept across the land,  
- the oldest civilisations were wiped out,  
- and millions of runes scattered across the world.

From the shattered essences of the Kings arose:

- **Common Runes** – minor fragments of their power  
- **Rare Runes** – concentrated domain shards  
- **Runic Monoliths** – fixed points of magic  
- **Echo Runes** – the largest and most dangerous remnants, containing traces of will  

Thus began the Age of Echoes.


## The Fate of the Guardians
The Guardians survived because they were not Domains —  
they were the interpretations, mediators and balancing forces.

But the Cataclysm:

- severed their connection to the Domains,  
- damaged their physical forms,  
- fragmented their memories,  
- and forced them to adopt humanoid disguises to survive.

They alone remember echoes of the truth.  
And they alone sense that the Cataclysm was not the final event —  
only the **first phase** of something far greater.


## Legacy of the Cataclysm
The Runic Cataclysm remains the foundation of the modern world:

- Runes fuel all magic.  
- Anomalies shape entire regions.  
- Bestial mutations roam the wilderness.  
- Civilisations arose from the ruins.  
- Religions formed around misunderstood Guardian encounters.  
- Echo Runes hold fragments of divine memory.  
- And the imbalance continues to grow, hinting at a coming second Cataclysm.

The old world died.  
A new one was born through destruction.  
But the echoes of the Seven still resonate — awakening slowly.


## Summary
The Runic Cataclysm:

- ended the reign of the Ancient Kings,  
- unified and then shattered their Domains,  
- created runes and modern magic,  
- reshaped the world,  
- scarred the Guardians,  
- and set the foundation for all current conflicts.

It was not madness.  
It was not malice.  
It was the **inevitable outcome of collapsing Domains**  
and the conscious decision of Melyon and Elyndor —  
the last two who understood what had to be done.
