# Echo of the Seven  
*A pixel-art 2D MMORPG world born from shattered divine power.*

**Echo of the Seven** is an early-stage game design project focused on worldbuilding, lore development, core mechanics and class concepts for a pixel-art RPG with a mix of epic high-fantasy, light humour and mysterious runic mythology.

This repository currently includes:
- Lore concepts (Ancient Kings, Modern Gods, Guardians)
- World structure and timeline drafts  
- Early class concepts (Priest as the first example)  
- Runic magic system foundations  
- Visual direction: 64×64 HD pixel-art (Style A+)  

More folders and documents will be added as the project grows.
